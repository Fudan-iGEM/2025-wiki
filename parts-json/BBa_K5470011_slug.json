The 2A reaction has been termed ‘StopGo’ or ‘stop-carry on’ recoding. The GSG linker placed between the gene and the 2A peptide is to improve the cleavage efficiency of the 2A peptide","type":{"uuid":"a797873a-d73a-454d-9c03-ee5dd5974980","label":"Coding","slug":"coding"},"licenseUUID":"d6c69ca7-8be4-4bc0-b4a8-d3ae1d428aa6","source":"NCBI","sequence":"GGTTCTGGTGGCGCTACCAATTTCTCACTACTAAAACTGGCGGGTGACGTCGAATTGAATCCCGGCCCT","audit":{"created":"2024-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-10-02T11:50:59.000Z"}}
