Ribozymes can be divided into RNA metalloenzymes and self-cleaving ribozymes. Studies have shown that self-cleaving ribozymes adopt a general acid-base catalytic mechanism to perform site-specific phosphodiester bond cleavage. Until now, only ten families of self-cleaving ribozymes have been discovered, and hammerhead ribozyme is one of them. By inserting the DNA sequence of hammerhead ribozyme between two coding sequences, mRNA transcribed by this gene will perform self cleavage at the ribozyme site, so that a long piece of mRNA will be cut into segments to prevent the translation process of various coding sequences from interfering with each other.","type":{"uuid":"258808a8-f859-4f0f-a1b9-17e591020eb8","label":"RNA","slug":"rna"},"licenseUUID":"d6c69ca7-8be4-4bc0-b4a8-d3ae1d428aa6","source":"Termed hammerhead, one of the ribozyme families.","sequence":"AGACAACCAGGAGTCTATAAAATAATCACTGAAGAGACTGGACGAAACCAATAGGTC","audit":{"created":"2022-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2023-06-16T07:49:21.000Z"}}
