Bax encodes a pro-apoptotic protein that promotes cell death in response to various stress signals, playing a significant role in regulating the balance between cell survival and death.\n\nIncorporating the bax gene can help researchers investigate mechanisms of apoptosis in different cell types. By placing bax under the control of a suitable promoter in your plasmid, you can induce its expression and assess its effects on cell viability and death, through ways such as the MTT cell viability assay or ELISA kits. This is particularly valuable for studying cancer biology, as many cancer cells evade apoptosis, contributing to tumor growth and resistance to therapy.","type":{"uuid":"a797873a-d73a-454d-9c03-ee5dd5974980","label":"Coding","slug":"coding"},"licenseUUID":"d6c69ca7-8be4-4bc0-b4a8-d3ae1d428aa6","source":"https://www.sinobiological.com/resource/bax/proteins (Rat BAX protein sequence)","sequence":"ATGGATGGCAGCGGCGAACAGCTGGGCAGCGGCGGCCCGACCAGCAGCGAACAGATTATGAAAACCGGCGCGTTTCTGCTGCACGGCTTTATTCAGGATCGCGCGGGCCGCATGGCGGGCGAAACCCCGGAACTGACCCTGGAACAGCCGCCGCAGGATGCGAGCACCAAAAAACTGAGCGAATGCCTGCGCCGCATTGGCGATGAACTGGATAGCAACATGGAACTGCACCGCATGATTGCGGATGTGGATACCGATAGCCCGCGCGAAGTGTTTTTTCGCGTGGCGGCGGATATGTTTGCGGATGGCAACTTTAACTGGGGCCGCGTGGTGGCGCTGTTTTATTTTGCGAGCAAACTGGTGCTGAAAGCGCTGTGCACCAAAGTGCCGGAACTGATTCGCACCATTATGGGCTGGACCCTGGATTTTCTGCGCGAACGCCTGCTGGTGTGGATTCAGGATCAGGGCGGCTGGGAAGGCCTGCTGAGCTATTTTGGCACCCCGACCTGGCAGACCGTGACCATTTTTGTGGCGGGCGTGCTGACCGCGAGCCTGACCATTTGGAAAAAAATGGGC","audit":{"created":"2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-10-02T09:34:14.000Z"}}
