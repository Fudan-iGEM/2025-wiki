Consisting of 60 aminoacids, the protein is rich in histidine (28 residues, 46.7 %) and contains short repeating motifs, it exists as an equilibration of multimeric forms in solution, with 20-mers (approx. 136 kDa) being the predominant species. Hpn can bind tightly and reversibly up to five Ni2+ ions per each monomer of 7 kDa in a pH-dependent manner (pH 7.4 ). In H. pylori play an important role in storing nickel required to the survival of the bacterium.","type":{"uuid":"a797873a-d73a-454d-9c03-ee5dd5974980","label":"Coding","slug":"coding"},"licenseUUID":"d6c69ca7-8be4-4bc0-b4a8-d3ae1d428aa6","source":"synthesized by IDT (as gblock)","sequence":"ATGGCACACCATGAAGAACAACACGGCGGACACCACCACCATCACCATCACAACACCACCACCACTACCATGGCGGCGAACACCACCATCACCACCACAGCTCTCATCATGAAGAAGGTTGTTGTAGCACTAGCGATAGTCATCATCAAGAAGAAGGTTGCTGCCACGGGCATCACGAGTAA","audit":{"created":"2013-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2021-09-08T20:23:43.000Z"}}
