Ribozymes can be divided into RNA metalloenzymes and self-cleaving ribozymes. Studies have shown that self-cleaving ribozymes adopt a general acid-base catalytic mechanism to perform site-specific phosphodiester bond cleavage. Until now, only ten families of self-cleaving ribozymes have been discovered, and hammerhead ribozyme is one of them. By inserting the DNA sequence of hammerhead ribozyme between two coding sequences, mRNA transcribed by this gene will perform self cleavage at the ribozyme site, so that a long piece of mRNA will be cut into segments to prevent the translation process of various coding sequences from interfering with each other. |RNA |57 |2023-06-16T07:49:21.000Z |RFC10 RFC1000 |0 |

Therefore, the long piece of mRNA it transcribes into will be spontaneously separated into four segments, which correspond to crtI, Y, E and B repectively. The translation process of these four enzymes is independent of each other, and the proportion of the expression products of four enzymes can be accurately adjusted by monitoring the intensity of RBS. |DNA |4896 |2022-10-07T06:35:11.000Z |RFC10 RFC1000 |0 |

|BBa_K5441013 |3061cbf2-e6c5-4cfd-8343-88aa38c2357c |BAX |The bax gene is a crucial component in the study of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Bax encodes a pro-apoptotic protein that promotes cell death in response to various stress signals, playing a significant role in regulating the balance between cell survival and death.        Incorporating the bax gene can help researchers investigate mechanisms of apoptosis in different cell types. By placing bax under the control of a suitable promoter in your plasmid, you can induce its expression and assess its effects on cell viability and death, through ways such as the MTT cell viability assay or ELISA kits. This is particularly valuable for studying cancer biology, as many cancer cells evade apoptosis, contributing to tumor growth and resistance to therapy. |Coding |576 |2024-10-02T09:34:14.000Z |RFC10 RFC1000 |0 |
