|BBa_K4162005 |6ef83b5c-d117-4c51-89c6-7a42ac8eca7c |Hammerhead ribozyme |Ribozymes are non-coding RNAs that can catalyze specific biochemical reactions without the assistance of proteins, involved in a variety of vital cellular reactions. Ribozymes can be divided into RNA metalloenzymes and self-cleaving ribozymes. Studies have shown that self-cleaving ribozymes adopt a general acid-base catalytic mechanism to perform site-specific phosphodiester bond cleavage. Until now, only ten families of self-cleaving ribozymes have been discovered, and hammerhead ribozyme is one of them. By inserting the DNA sequence of hammerhead ribozyme between two coding sequences, mRNA transcribed by this gene will perform self cleavage at the ribozyme site, so that a long piece of mRNA will be cut into segments to prevent the translation process of various coding sequences from interfering with each other. |RNA |57 |2023-06-16T07:49:21.000Z |RFC10 RFC1000 |0 |

These genes are a part of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and together, this biobrick converts farnesyl pyrophosphate to beta-carotene. In this part, crtIYEB are separated by hammerhead ribozyme, which can perform self-cleaving. Therefore, the long piece of mRNA it transcribes into will be spontaneously separated into four segments, which correspond to crtI, Y, E and B repectively. The translation process of these four enzymes is independent of each other, and the proportion of the expression products of four enzymes can be accurately adjusted by monitoring the intensity of RBS. |DNA |4896 |2022-10-07T06:35:11.000Z |RFC10 RFC1000 |0 |

The system utilizes the lac operon-based regulation, where IPTG induction activates T7 RNA polymerase, initiating transcription of the papain coding sequence. A His-tag is fused to the protein to facilitate purification via affinity chromatography. This design enables efficient production and downstream application of recombinant papain for functional assays such as protein degradation or skin exfoliation. |Plasmid |5099 |2025-09-09T02:34:32.184Z |RFC10 RFC1000 |0 |
