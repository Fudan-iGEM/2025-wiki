## Golden Gate Assembly

As described in Shaw et al. (2023)[^1], briefly: 

### Vector Ligation

1. Normalize the concentration of all DNA parts prior to assembly. Use a nanodrop or fluorometric method for quantification.

   `Accurate DNA quantification and normalization are crucial for high assembly efficiency.`

   - **Inserts/Plasmids:** Dilute to a final concentration of 50 fmol/&mu;L.
   - **Plasmid Backbones:** Dilute to a final concentration of 25 fmol/&mu;L.

2. Prepare the Golden Gate reaction mixtures in PCR tube：

   `Assemble reactions on ice to prevent premature enzyme activity, and put the enzymes back immediately after use!`

   `For multiple reactions, create a master mix. The total number of reactions can be overcounted by 0.1 allowing for the inaccuracy of pipettes.`

   |       |                      Reagent                       |        Volume (&mu;L)         |   Final Concentration/Amount    |
   | :---: | :------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
   | **1** |      Each DNA Insert/Plasmid (50 fmol/&mu;L)       |              0.5              |             25 fmol             |
   | **2** |          Plasmid Backbone (25 fmol/&mu;L)          |              0.5              |            12.5 fmol            |
   | **3** |              10x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer              |               1               |               1x                |
   | **4** |            T4 DNA Ligase (400 U/&mu;L)             |              0.5              |              200 U              |
   | **5** | Restriction Enzyme (BsaI-HFv2 or BsmBI v2 or BpiI) |              0.5              | 10 U (BsaI) or 5 U (BsmBI/BbsI) |
   | **6** |                Nuclease-Free Water                 | to a final volume of 10 &mu;L |                -                |
   |       |                     **Total**                      |            **10**             |                                 |

   `Do not confuse BpiI (for marker assembly with high efficiency) with BsaI or BsmBI!`

3. Place the reaction tubes in a thermocycler and run the following program: 

   - For level 1 and level 2 golden gate assembly: 

     a. **Cycling (25 cycles):**

     - **Digestion:**

       - For BsaI: 37°C for 2 min.

       - For BsmBI: 42°C for 2 min.

         `For reactions with more than 6 inserts, increase digestion time to 5 min.`

     - **Ligation:** 16°C for 5 min.

     b. **Final Digestion:** 55°C for 10 min.

     c. **Heat Inactivation:** 80°C for 10 min.

     d. **Hold:** 4°C

   - For marker assembly: 

     a. **Cycling (10 cycles):**

     - **Digestion:** 37°C for 2 min.
     - **Ligation:** 16°C for 5 min.

     b. **Final Digestion:** 55°C for 10 min.

     c. **Heat Inactivation:** 80°C for 10 min.

     d. **Hold:** 4°C

### Transformation and Plating

1.  Thaw one 50 &mu;L aliquot of competent *E. coli* with high transformation efficiency (> 1 x 10^8 cfu/&mu;g) on ice for each assembly reaction.
2.  Add the entire 10 &mu;L Golden Gate reaction mixture to the cells. Gently mix.
3.  Incubate on ice for 30 min.
4.  Heat shock the cells at 42°C for 45 s.
5.  Immediately return the tube to ice for 2 min.
6.  Add 950 &mu;L of SOC or LB medium (pre-warmed to 37°C).
7.  Incubate at 37°C with shaking (250 rpm) for 1 h.
8.  Plate 100-200 &mu;L of the culture onto an LB agar plate containing the appropriate antibiotic.
    `Ensure the antibiotic on the plate matches the resistance marker of the destination plasmid backbone.`
9.  Incubate plates overnight at 37°C.

### Colony Screening and Validation

For For level 1 and level 2 golden gate assembly: 

- Screen bacterial colonies for the loss of the fluorescent dropout cassette (sfGFP or mScarlet) using a blue light transilluminator.

  `Put the plate upside down if the blue light comes from bottom. Turn off the transilluminator as quickly as possible to prevent the damage from blue light!`

- Pick 2-4 non-fluorescent (correctly assembled) colonies for each construct.

For marker assembly: 

- Pick a random colony from the plate.

Then, 

1.  Inoculate colonies into liquid LB medium with the appropriate antibiotic and grow overnight.
2.  Perform a [plasmid miniprep](#Other Experimental Methods) to isolate the assembled plasmid DNA.
3.  Validate the plasmid structure using [restriction digestion (e.g., with NotI-HF)](#DNA Digestion) and [agarose gel electrophoresis](#Other Experimental Methods).
4.  Analyze the fragment sizes to confirm the correct assembly. Input band sizes from multiple clones to check for consistency.

### Expanded Golden Gate

As described in Sorida et al. (2023)[^2], briefly: 

1. Prepare the Expanded Golden Gate reaction mixtures in PCR tube：

   |       |           Reagent           |    Volume (&mu;L)    |
   | :---: | :-------------------------: | :------------------: |
   | **1** | Restriction Enzyme 1 (XhoI) |         0.2          |
   | **2** | Restriction Enzyme 2 (XbaI) |         0.2          |
   | **3** |  10x T4 DNA Ligase Buffer   |          1           |
   | **4** |      Hi-T4 DNA Ligase       |         0.4          |
   | **5** |          10 mM ATP          |          1           |
   | **6** |           Vector            |      0.05 pmol       |
   | **7** |     Nuclease-Free Water     | Bring up to 10 &mu;L |
   |       |          **Total**          |        **10**        |

2. Incubate the reaction at 37°C for 1 h, and then 65°C for 20 min to heat inactivate the enzymes.

3. Take 1 &mu;L product, add 0.5 &mu;L new 5'/3' HA and 0.5 &mu;L BsmBI to a total reaction volume of 2 &mu;L, and then conduct [Golden Gate assembly](#Golden Gate Assembly).

4. Once correct clones are obtained, use BpiI to [introduce the selection marker into the vector](#Golden Gate Assembly).

The principle diagram is shown in [design](#).



## Site-Directed Mutagenesis PCR

As described in Liu et al. (2008)[^3], briefly: 

### Primer Design

Primers were designed as in Liu et al. (2008) Figure 2[^3]. The non-overlapping sequences are larger (significantly larger than suggested in [^4])than the complementary sequences to make the melting temperature of non-overlapping sequences (Tm no, 47.5-60.2) 5 to 10°C higher than the melting temperature of primer-primer complementary sequences (41.1-50.3 Tm pp < Tm no).

### PCR Reaction Setup

1. Prepare the PCR master mix in a 0.2-mL microcentrifuge tube on ice: 

   |       |             Reagent              | Final Concentration/Amount |
   | :---: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------: |
   | **1** | Template DNA / Bacteria Solution |      1-5 ng / 1 &mu;L      |
   | **2** |             F-primer             |          1 &mu;M           |
   | **3** |             R-primer             |          1 &mu;M           |
   | **4** |               dNTP               |         0.5 &mu;M          |
   | **5** |              Phanta              |         0.2 &mu;L          |
   | **6** |        10x Phanta Buffer         |         12.5 &mu;L         |
   | **7** |        ddH­<sub>2</sub>O         |    Bring up to 25 &mu;L    |
   |       |            **Total**             |           **25**           |

2. Place the reaction tubes in a thermocycler and run the following program:

   - For bacteria solution:  95°C for 3 min.

   b. **Amplification (12 cycles):**

   -   **Denaturation:** 95°C for 15 s.
   -   **Annealing:** T<sub>m no</sub> - 5°C for 15 s.
   -   **Extension:** 72°C for appropriate time (according to the length of the template constructs, for Phanta DNA polymerase is 30-60 s/kb)

   c. **Final Annealing:** T<sub>m pp</sub> - 5°C for 15 s.

   d. **Final Extension:** 72°C for 10 min.

3. Treat each tube of PCR products with 0.5 &mu;L DpnI at 37°C for 2 h.

   `When taking up enzymes stored in glycerin, look carefully to avoid big drops of liquid hanging on the tip of the pipette. If there are any, lean them against the wall of the tube.`

4. Analyze each PCR reaction by [agarose gel electrophoresis](#Other Experimental Methods). Once verified, the PCR products were [transformed](#Other Experimental Methods) respectively into *E. coli* Turbo competent cells by heat shock.

2. Dilute the cultures at 1:20 into 4 mL of fresh YPD and incubate at 30°C with 220 rpm shaking.
3. Every 1 h, 200 µL of the cultures was sampled from the 4 mL YPD cultures and mixed with 800 µL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O to achieve a 5-fold dilution.
4. Measure OD600 of the diluted samples and draw the growth curve.




## Flow Cytometry of Single Cell Yeast

Flow cytometry is performed to detect the fluorescence of [TU recorder](/design/#recorder) transformed into BY4741 or BY4742.

1. Pick strains into 3 mL synthetic complete (SC) medium and grow them at 30°C with 250 rpm shaking overnight.

2. Take 2 mL cultures into a 2-mL tube and pellet the cells by spinning at 8,000 *g* for 1 min.

   - For cells whose flourescence is smURFP or miRFP670-2, take 1 mL of fresh yeast culture (OD600 > 1), centrifuge the cells at 8,000 *g* for 1 min and resuspend the pellet in 100 &mu;L SC complete medium, and then add 10 &mu;L of 1 mM PCB shaking for 1 h in the dark[^7].

     > We greatly appreciate Dr. Chuanwei Yang and Dr. Lin Li for providing us with ready to use phycocyanobilin (PCB) 1 mM solution in our initial test, and Dr. Hongtai Liu for sending PCB powder on the same day which is enough for the following year!

3. Wash the pellet with PBS and resuspend the cell in 1 mL PBS.

4. Measure cell fluorescence using CytoFlex LX according to the following settings: FSC 300 V, SSC 350 V, gating for singlets using FSC-A vs SSC-H. Record 4 channels of fluorescence (Y585-A, B525-A, R660-A, V450-A) at the same time.



## EMS Mutagenesis

As described in Hodgins-Davis et al. (2019)[^8], briefly: 

1. Wash a 2 mL aliquot of saturated culture (~10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL) twice in 5 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O, and then resuspend in 2 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 7).
2. Divide the culture into two 1 mL aliquots in 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes. 
3. Add 10 &mu;L EMS (99%) to one sample (EMS treatment), but not the other (sham treatment), and seal both samples with parafilm. 
4. Incubate both samples at room temperature on a rotor for mixing for 45 min.
5. Treat both samples with 1 mL of EMS-neutralizing sodium thiosulfate (5%).
6. Pellet and resuspend cells in 1 mL of sodium thiosulfate (5%), twice in 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O, and finally suspend cells in 1 mL of YPD. 



## Grape Yeast Cluster Size Measurement

As described in Tong et al. (2025)[^6], briefly: 

### Strain Revival and Culture Growth

1. Revive strains from glycerol stocks by growing them on YPD plates at 30°C for 2 days.
2. Inoculate each strain into 10 mL of YPD media. Grow at 30°C with 220 rpm shaking for 3 days, performing daily settling selection before transferring to fresh media.
3. On the last day, after settling selection and transfer, grow the cultures for 24 hours. Sample them at 4 hours (exponential phase) and 24 hours (stationary phase) for measuring cluster size.

### Sample Preparation for Imaging

1. Gently shake each culture by hand. In a 24-well plate, add an appropriate volume of the culture (1–250 &mu;L) to H<sub>2</sub>O containing 10 &mu;L of 16% (w/v) formaldehyde, making a final volume of 510 &mu;L per well. 
2. For macroscopic strains, use wide-bore 1-mL tips and sample twice from each culture into two separate wells.
3. Gently shake the 24-well plate to evenly spread out the clusters and allow 5–10 minutes for clusters to settle.

### Image Acquisition and Analysis

Use a microscope to scan the entire well. Take and stitch 5 × 8 bright-field, shading-corrected images with 10% overlap at ×4 magnification, scanning at 1 mm/s.

Use ImageJ for a semi-automated image analysis pipeline:

1. Segment clusters using auto local thresholding and split touching clusters using seed-based watershed.
2. Perform manual correction as needed.
3. Measure the cross-sectional area of each cluster.
4. Remove segmented objects with an area below 40 &mu;m².
5. Using R, convert cluster areas to cluster volumes and radiuses, treating clusters as perfect spheres.
6. For each strain, calculate its biomass-weighted mean cluster radius by first calculating its mean cluster volume weighted by cluster volume, and then converting it to a radius.



## Cell Volume and Aspect Ratio Measurement

As described in Tong et al. (2025)[^6], briefly: 

### Strain Revival and Culture Growth

1. Revive strains from glycerol stocks by growing them on YPD plates at 30°C for 2 days.
2. Inoculate each strain into 10 mL of YPD media and grow at 30°C with 220 rpm shaking for 3 days. Perform daily settling selection before transferring to fresh media each day.
3. On the last day, transfer 100 &mu;L of culture (without settling selection) to 10 mL of fresh media and grow for 12 hours.

### Sample Preparation for Imaging

1. Transfer 25 &mu;L of each culture to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube. 
2. For macroscopic strains, use 100-&mu;L wide-bore tips to sample the culture and break clusters into tiny pieces by pipetting with 100-&mu;L regular-bore tips.
3. Pellet the cells by spinning at 5,000 *g*, and then wash the pellet with 1 mL of 1× PBS.
4. Resuspend the pellet and incubate in 100 &mu;L of 5 &mu;M Calcofluor White in 1× PBS at room temperature.
5. Gently crush 5 &mu;L of stained clusters into a single layer of cells between a microscope slide and a coverslip. Avoid shearing the cells.

### Image Acquisition

1. Take brightfield and fluorescent (UV channel) images of at least five fields of view (FOVs) per strain at ×40 magnification.
2. For each FOV, set the focus in the brightfield channel by manually moving to a z-plane where cells look grey, then move down by 0.7 &mu;m for sharp fluorescent signals.

### Image Analysis

1. Use a semi-automated image analysis pipeline with Cellpose to perform automated cell segmentation. Specify a cell diameter of 80 pixels for images with 0.073 &mu;m per pixel. Run on GPUs.
2. Manually correct the segmentation using the Cellpose Graphical User Interface (GUI).
3. Use ImageJ to measure the area, lengths of major and minor axis, aspect ratio, and solidity of each cell.
4. Remove segmented objects with an area below 1 &mu;m² or a solidity below 0.8.
5. Using R, calculate cell volumes using the formula V = 4/3 × πab², where a and b are the lengths of the major and minor axis of each cell, respectively.



## Imaging-based Ploidy Measurement of Grape Yeast

As described in Tong et al. (2025)[^6], briefly: 

In every experiment, two control strains with known ploidy, namely, the engineered grande diploid and tetraploid grape yeast, also went through the same procedure of sample preparation and imaging. 

### Propidium Iodide Staining

1. Grow each strain of interest in YPD media to mid-log phase.
2. Transfer 250 &mu;L of the culture into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube. 
3. Pellet the clusters by spinning at 5,000 *g* for 1 min and wash them with 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O.
   `For macroscopic strains, break the clusters into small pieces by pipetting vigorously using 100 &mu;L regular-bore tips before washing.` 
4. Fix and permeabilize the cells in 1 mL of 70% ethanol at room temperature for 2 h with end-to-end rotation on a mini-rotator at a speed of 40 rpm. 
5. Centrifugat for ethanol removal and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 50 mM sodium citrate twice. 
6. Resuspend the clusters in 200 &mu;L of 50 mM sodium citrate containing 0.5 mg/ml RNase A and incubate them in a 37 °C heat block for 2 h with gentle inversion every 30 min (as clusters settle over time). 
7. After RNA digestion, add 5  &mu;L of 1 mg /mL propidium iodide and incubate the mixture in a 30 °C incubator in dark overnight with rotation on a mini-rotator at  at a speed of 10 rpm to keep clusters from settling.
8. Propidium iodide-stained clusters can be stored at 4 °C for no longer than 1 week before imaging.

### Fluorescent Imaging

1. Crush 5 &mu;L of propidium iodide-stained clusters into a single layer of cells between a microscope slide and a coverslip.
2. For each sample, take 14-bit images of approximately 10 FOVs at ×20 magnification. 
3. For each FOV (fields of view), set the focus by manually moving to a *z*-plane in which cells look grey (rather than brighter or darker) in the brightfield channel and then moving down by 1 &mu;m to get sharp fluorescent signals of the nuclei. 
4. Image the flattened clusters in the red fluorescent channel (exposure of 600 ms and gain of 2.2×) at the focal plane as well as one *z*-plane 0.3 &mu;m above and below the focal plane (three *z*-planes in total) to detect the propidium iodide-stained nuclei, and then imaged in the brightfield channel (exposure of 100 ms and gain of 4.1×) at the focal plane. 
5. Set the exposure and gain of the fluorescent channel such that the brightest pixels in the tetraploid control strain are approximately 80% of the maximal allowed pixel value while minimizing photobleaching and noise.

### Image Analysis

Images were quantitatively analyzed by ImageJ.

1. Perform maximum intensity projection of the three *z*-planes taken in the fluorescent channel and used the resulting image for segmentation and fluorescence quantification.
2. Segment nuclei and filter them to include only single round nuclei.
3. Measure the total propidium iodide fluorescence intensity of each nucleus with background subtraction, in which the background fluorescence is the median propidium iodide fluorescence intensity of the cytoplasm in the cluster that the focal nucleus is in. The resulting nuclear propidium iodide intensity scales linearly with the DNA content.

Analyze the image analysis results in R. 

1. For each sample, remove tiny segmented objects with areas two median absolute deviations below median (which are nucleus segmentation artefacts).
2. Manually remove FOVs with outlier distributions of nuclear propidium iodide intensity. The distribution of nuclear propidium iodide intensity in a clonal strain contains two peaks that correspond to G1-phase and G2-phase cells.
3. Estimate the DNA content of each nucleus by dividing its propidium iodide intensity with the propidium iodide intensity of a haploid genome, which was estimated by averaging across the two ploidy control strains, that is, mean (G1 peak intensity of diploid control strain/2, G1 peak intensity of tetraploid control strain/4).
4. Estimate the DNA content of a clonal strain as the DNA content of its G1 peak.



## Chitin staining

We stained cells with calcofluor white as described in Tong et al. (2025)[^6], briefly: 

1. Sample 150 μL from the cell culture from the ancestor.
2. Remove the supernatant through an iterated process of centrifugation and pipetting medium removal. 
3. Build 15 μL of 1 mg/mL calcofluor solution into 500 μL 1× phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and mixed with the yeast pellet. 
4. Incubate the sample in the dark at room temperature for 25 min.
5. Remove the calcofluor media by centrifugation and pipetting. 
6. Add 200 μL 1× PBS on top of the pellet. A total of 20 μL of this cell suspension was pipetted onto a clean glass slide and covered with a coverslip for microscopy analysis.



## Yeast Live-cell Imaging in Agarose

1. Grow yeast overnight in 3 mL of YPD at 30 °C with 220 rpm shaking.

2. Dilute the overnight cultures 1:20 into fresh YPD and incubate at 30°C with 220 rpm shaking until OD600 between 0.7-1.

3. Prepare 0.4% low melting agarose in SC complete media.

4. Add ∼200 µL of melted agarose onto a glass-bottom dish or slide and allow it to solidify, forming a thin pad.

5. Spot 2–5 µL of the yeast culture onto the agarose pad and carefully cover with a coverslip.

   `Avoid air bubbles!`

6. Observe cells immediately using a fluorescence or confocal microscope equipped with appropriate filters.

   `Maintain stage temperature at 30°C if live-cell imaging requires long-term observation.Also, minimize light exposure to reduce photobleaching and phototoxicity.`



## Mating of *a* and &alpha; Yeast Strains

As described in Tong et al. (2025)[^6], briefly: 

1. Inoculate *a* and *&alpha;* strains separately into liquid medium and grow overnight at 30°C until cultures reach saturation.

2. Mix the two cultures at a 1:1 ratio.

3. Spot 10 &mu;L of the mixture onto a solid agar plate.

4. Allow the spot to air-dry for ~10 min, then incubate the plate inverted at 30°C for ~24 h.

5. Following incubation, pick a small portion from the mating spot and streak onto selective medium with Nat and Hyg (containing both antibiotics) to isolate single colonies.

   `Yeasts mate more efficiently on solid medium~`
