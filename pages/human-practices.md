description: On this page, we show how Human Practices guided our project to be both scientifically innovative and socially responsible.
---

## Overview

Our Integrated Human Practices journey began with a simple question: *Is technology inherently good or bad?*
 Guided by this reflection, we built our project around responsibility, inclusivity, and real-world relevance. Through dialogues with scientists, clinicians, and policymakers, we shaped a multicellular yeast platform inspired by the “AI Yeast System” concept to address antifungal resistance. From early conceptual debates to clinical fieldwork and ethical reflections, each encounter refined our design and ensured our work remained scientifically sound and socially conscious — a project truly created for humanity, not just by technology.

### **Integrated Human Practices: Designing for Responsibility**

> “Our technology has exceeded our humanity.”
> ——Albert Einstein

These words are not just a warning — they are a mirror. This qote became the seed of our Human Practices journey. It made us pause and reflect—not only on what we could create, but on why and for whom we were creating it.

Through months of dialogue—with scientists, clinicians, policymakers, and designers—we sought to weave inclusivity, reflection, and real-world responsiveness into every part of our work. What follows is the story of how each encounter reshaped our understanding of what it means to build technology that serves humanity.

### What's Wrong with Our Technology?

Our journey began with a simple but profound question: What's Wrong with Our Technology?

During the winter vacation, we launched a **science-by-letter outreach program** to introduce synthetic biology to students across China.

In our letters, we explained how scientists design and modify organisms to perform beneficial functions and outlined our educational framework. We also posed open-ended questions, such as:

- What does biology look like to you?
- Are you familiar with any cutting-edge synthetic biology technologies?
- How much do you think these technologies impact living organisms?

The students responded with enthusiasm, sharing their curiosity, challenges, and creative ideas. One question, however, stood out:

> “Is this ‘new’ technology truly beneficial or harmful? Will it make a real difference? Does it genuinely matter to society?”

This simple yet profound doubt prompted us to pause and reflect. Through this activity, we began to **consider whether synthetic biology technologies inherently have “good” or “bad” effects**. For example, the development of antibiotics is a clear technological advancement—but does it serve as a blessing for humanity, or could it also bring unforeseen challenges?

This reflection naturally led us to examine our own project. We asked: how can we ensure that the technologies we develop provide real societal benefits rather than unintended problems? Guided by these questions, we embarked on further exploration and practical efforts, designing our project to not only advance science but also respond meaningfully to human needs and ethical considerations.

## From Reflection to Design: The Birth of an Idea

Our first conversation was with **Dr. Boxun Lu**, a neurobiologist at Fudan University, who envisioned an “AI Yeast System” capable of simulating living cells. His idea helped us see beyond biology as a purely experimental process—it could also be computational, predictive, and creative.
His insight inspired our modeling strategy: using simulation-driven design to predict antifungal resistance pathways. It was here that the concept of *multicellular yeast* as a research platform was born.

>
> **Topic:** Science Governance, Ethics, and Public Communication  
> **Key Takeaways:**  
>
> - Prof Tang's research focuses on developing databases including sci-tech literature (1980–2024), thematic databases, and global synthetic biology policy databases such as Overton. It also involves synthetic biology governance, contributing to the Tianjin Guidelines, cross-cultural GITA studies, and science communication.  
>
> - Inclusive science communication should emphasize both the benefits and risks of synthetic biology, while addressing ethical boundaries such as informed consent and scientist conduct.  
>
> - For policy advice, tools like PKU FAZHENG can be used for research, and international governance and safety should be highlighted in public materials. Key challenges include public resistance and regulatory delays, such as slow approvals for novel materials.  
>
> - Safety concerns involve critical issues like drug resistance, gene leakage, and intellectual property theft. National governance includes measures such as wet/dry lab separation and dynamic black/white/grey lists.  
>
> - In China, policy flexibility is essential due to regional diversity, making direct student involvement in policy drafting less feasible compared to smaller countries. Competition judges are aware of these contextual constraints.

Prof. Tang’s guidance linked policy and practice, reminding us that science and governance must evolve together for sustainable impact.

## Beyond the "Humans", More "Humans"

As our project matured, we expanded our scope beyond academia, exploring how our technology could generate tangible value and empathy in the real world.

> **Topic：** Commercialization of the Visualization Tracking Platform
> **Key Takeaways：**
>
> - **Differentiated Pricing Strategy:** It is recommended to adopt a multi-tiered pricing model. This could include a low-cost basic software package to attract early adopters, alongside a premium, high-priced "enterprise edition" that includes dedicated technical support, custom analysis, and regular updates. The goal is to capture different segments of the CRO market.
> - **Focus on Financial Metrics & Value Proposition:** Investors pay close attention to a company's financial health. The business plan must clearly outline the path to profitability. It is crucial to quantitatively demonstrate how the platform can help CRO clients reduce R&D cycles, lower costs, or increase success rates, translating the technical advantage into clear financial value.
> - **Target Market Refinement:** While targeting the Yangtze River Delta CROs is a good start, it is recommended to further define the "beachhead" market. Focus initially on small to medium-sized CROs that are more agile in adopting new technologies, before expanding to larger, established players.
> - **Emphasize Data Assets:** Beyond the tool itself, the platform's potential to generate unique, proprietary datasets from client use is a significant long-term asset. This data can be leveraged for future AI model training, new drug target discovery, or industry reports, creating additional revenue streams.

> **Topic：** Medical Space Design and Wayfinding Systems
> **Key Takeaways：**
> We have a better understand of how to strike a balance  healthcare efficiency and patient-centered care in scienfic perspectives.
>
> - Environmental controls (e.g., ICU fungal limits) are strict in China, sometimes at the expense of humanistic elements.
> - Materials: Stainless steel is common for cleanability; antimicrobial fabrics and copper are used in high-end hospitals but limited by cost.
> - Disinfection protocols are more critical than material selection.
> - Wayfinding principles we can follow in our inclusive design+ :
>   - Prioritize elderly needs with clear visual cues.
>   - Place signs at high-traffic areas (entrances, low-floor departments).
>   - Ground-level signage is highly intuitive; mobile navigation is emerging.
>   - Use of colors and animal themes (e.g., children’s hospitals) enhances accessibility.
> - Balancing functionality and healing:
>   - Trend toward "de-medicalization" and social integration (e.g., hospital as mall/hotel).
>   - Nursing care and micro-environments (e.g., atriums, movie corners) are key.
>   - Art, lighting, music, and color improve therapeutic ambiance.
>   - Look to Singapore and Hong Kong for relevant design references.

This final dialogue brought us full circle — from technological design to human experience, reminding us that science must heal as much as it innovates.

## Summary

Our Integrated Human Practices journey began with a student's profound question: "Is this technology truly beneficial?" This sparked a reflective process that fundamentally shaped our project. Through consultations with experts in evolutionary biology, clinical mycology, and synthetic biology, we refined our multicellular yeast platform to address the urgent challenge of antifungal resistance. Our clinical immersion at Huashan Hospital transformed this from a technical concept into a human-centered mission. By engaging with anthropologists, policy experts, and fellow iGEM teams, we embedded ethical considerations and public dialogue into our project's development, ensuring DR.sTraTeGY evolves as a socially responsible innovation with meaningful real-world impact.
