## What's Wrong with Our Technology?

In recent years, the growing problem of fungal drug resistance has pushed countless patients battling fungal infections into even greater difficulty. People are beginning to realize that the unrestrained and irrational use of antibiotics has only nurtured the rise of so-called “super fungi.”

During the winter vacation, our team launched an outreach project — a letter exchange with middle school students — to share stories about synthetic biology. Across mountains and oceans, one young student wrote to us and asked a question that stopped us in our tracks:

> “Are the ‘new things’ created through synthetic biology beneficial or harmful?”

<div> <p><small style="color: gray">The letter from the young student</small></p> </div>

That innocent question struck a deep chord. It made us pause and reflect: how should we use our technologies wisely and responsibly?
From that moment, we knew this was where our journey for the year would begin.



## The Potential of Multicellular Yeast?

During our winter-break training, we introduced the concept of using multicellular yeast as the chassis for our synthetic-biology system.However, many aspects remained undefined — from the natural characteristics to the mechanisms of differentiation and the potential application scenarios.

> Professor Lu suggested that with the rise of large-scale AI models, an exciting direction is to simulate living cells through artificial digital systems — what he called an “AI Yeast System.” Such a concept, he noted, could have transformative implications for biopharmaceutical research and resonated strongly with our project’s vision of simulation-driven design.

His insights inspired us profoundly and laid the foundation for our modeling strategy to predict and guide experimental design (see our [Model Page](https://2025.igem.wiki/fudan/model.html)).
After extensive discussion, we refined our idea and decided to employ multicellular yeast as a platform for dynamic screening of antibiotic-resistance targets — forming the initial blueprint of the project we are developing today.

**Key Takeaways：**

- **Gradual Development of AIVC:** The development of Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVC) might be a gradual process. It relies on an iterative approach where data collection and model refinement are continuously integrated. Rather than starting from an exhaustive understanding of all biological, chemical, and physical aspects of cells, AIVC development builds upon existing knowledge and progressively improves through experimentation and simulation. This iterative cycle allows for reliable simulations and predictions even as the complexity of the virtual cell model increases over time.

- **Applying the Above Approach Beyond Biology:** This gradual approach to model building is not limited to computational biology. It also offers valuable insights for societal engagement. Just as we don’t need to fully understand every detail of a cell to create useful models, we don’t need to understand every individual or cultural nuance to engage meaningfully with society. The key is maintaining an open mind, actively listening, and continuously refining our understanding through interaction. By doing so, we can create more effective connections and foster cooperation in both science and society.

> **Key Takeaways：**
>
> - Human Practice is both a process-oriented and reflexive practice that requires researchers to "use oneself as a method" and embed themselves within the research.
>
> - HP content should be closely related to the project theme, avoiding quantity-over-quality or fragmented practices in favor of well-designed, refined HP activities.
>
> - Researchers should thoughtfully consider the subjects of their practice surveys and select the most appropriate research methods based on the research questions, avoiding methods like convenience sampling or snowball sampling that may introduce bias.
>
> - Shared insights from medical anthropology, including the original intent behind the iGEM design maturity model and the understanding of "Integrity."
>
> - Encouraged the team to "spend energy on what you truly want to do," emphasizing the importance of pursuing meaningful and personally motivating work.

> **Topic：**Science Governance, Ethics, and Public Communication
> **Key Takeaways：**
>
> - Prof Tang's research focuses on developing databases including sci-tech literature (1980–2024), thematic databases, and global synthetic biology policy databases such as Overton. It also involves synthetic biology governance, contributing to the Tianjin Guidelines, cross-cultural GITA studies, and science communication.
>
> - Inclusive science communication should emphasize both the benefits and risks of synthetic biology, while addressing ethical boundaries such as informed consent and scientist conduct.
>
> - For policy advice, tools like PKU FAZHENG can be used for research, and international governance and safety should be highlighted in public materials. Key challenges include public resistance and regulatory delays, such as slow approvals for novel materials.
>
> - Safety concerns involve critical issues like drug resistance, gene leakage, and intellectual property theft. National governance includes measures such as wet/dry lab separation and dynamic black/white/grey lists.
>
> - In China, policy flexibility is essential due to regional diversity, making direct student involvement in policy drafting less feasible compared to smaller countries. Competition judges are aware of these contextual constraints.

## Beyond the "Humans", More "Humans"

Connect to more entrepreneurship...遍一编，还有其他能扯的也扯

> **Topic：** Commercialization of the Visualization Tracking Platform
> **Key Takeaways：**
>
> - **Differentiated Pricing Strategy:** It is recommended to adopt a multi-tiered pricing model. This could include a low-cost basic software package to attract early adopters, alongside a premium, high-priced "enterprise edition" that includes dedicated technical support, custom analysis, and regular updates. The goal is to capture different segments of the CRO market.
> - **Focus on Financial Metrics & Value Proposition:** Investors pay close attention to a company's financial health. The business plan must clearly outline the path to profitability. It is crucial to quantitatively demonstrate how the platform can help CRO clients reduce R&D cycles, lower costs, or increase success rates, translating the technical advantage into clear financial value.
> - **Target Market Refinement:** While targeting the Yangtze River Delta CROs is a good start, it is recommended to further define the "beachhead" market. Focus initially on small to medium-sized CROs that are more agile in adopting new technologies, before expanding to larger, established players.
> - **Emphasize Data Assets:** Beyond the tool itself, the platform's potential to generate unique, proprietary datasets from client use is a significant long-term asset. This data can be leveraged for future AI model training, new drug target discovery, or industry reports, creating additional revenue streams.

>
> - Environmental controls (e.g., ICU fungal limits) are strict in China, sometimes at the expense of humanistic elements.
> - Materials: Stainless steel is common for cleanability; antimicrobial fabrics and copper are used in high-end hospitals but limited by cost.
> - Disinfection protocols are more critical than material selection.
> - Wayfinding principles we can follow in our inclusive design+ :
>   - Prioritize elderly needs with clear visual cues.
>   - Place signs at high-traffic areas (entrances, low-floor departments).
>   - Ground-level signage is highly intuitive; mobile navigation is emerging.
>   - Use of colors and animal themes (e.g., children’s hospitals) enhances accessibility.
> - Balancing functionality and healing:
>   - Trend toward "de-medicalization" and social integration (e.g., hospital as mall/hotel).
>   - Nursing care and micro-environments (e.g., atriums, movie corners) are key.
>   - Art, lighting, music, and color improve therapeutic ambiance.
>   - Look to Singapore and Hong Kong for relevant design references.
