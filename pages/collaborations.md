## Overview: A Collaborative Journey

Our project's success is deeply rooted in the vibrant iGEM community, which provided invaluable theoretical guidance and a dynamic platform for practical application. We are proud to have collaborated with a diverse network of partners, united by a shared mission to advance our project's goals while empowering the iGEM ecosystem.

This cooperation was guided by the dual principles of "serving project objectives" and "empowering the iGEM community," building three core collaboration systems:

1. iGEM Cross-Team Mutual Assistance
2.  Public Welfare: Building Partnerships for Impact
3. Building Bridges: Industrial Insights and Commercialization Exploration

All partnerships were forged in the spirit of iGEM's values, ensuring mutual benefit and a focus on solving real-world problems.

## Empowering the iGEM Community and Advancing Academia

We believe the core strength of iGEM lies in its collaborative spirit. Acting as a hub for knowledge exchange, we engaged deeply with the global community and sought academic expertise to push the boundaries of our project.

### National Conferences: Synergy at Scale

#### [The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai iGEM meet-up ](https://2025.igem.wiki/fudan/human-practices.htm)

We actively participated in this regional conference at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, which gathered more than 110 participants. This event was instrumental in aligning regional efforts, refining our project through feedback, and building a strong collaborative network in Eastern China.

#### [Beijing CCiC & Synbiopunk 2025](https://2025.igem.wiki/fudan/human-practices.htm)

We attended this integrated event, which attracted over 1,000 synthetic biology researchers and developers globally. We presented our work in the CCiC poster session and participated in SynCamp unconferences on critical topics like biosafety and AI. This experience provided invaluable feedback from both academic and industry perspectives, strengthening our commitment to responsible innovation.

## Summary

Our collaboration was guided by the principles of *serving project goals* and *empowering the iGEM community*. Through cross-team exchanges, expert guidance, and partnerships with schools, communities, patients, and industry, we co-created educational tools, organized public outreach, refined our project design, and explored real-world applications. Together, these collaborations bridged academia, society, and industry—transforming synthetic biology into a shared effort for education, empowerment, and innovation.
