## A Collaborative Journey

Our project's success is deeply rooted in the vibrant iGEM community, which provided invaluable theoretical guidance and a dynamic platform for practical application. We are proud to have collaborated with a diverse network of partners, united by a shared mission to advance our project's goals while empowering the iGEM ecosystem.

This cooperation was guided by the dual principles of "serving project goals" and "empowering the iGEM community". We collaborated with three types of partners:

1. iGEM **Cross-Team** Mutual Assistance
2. **Public Welfare:** Building Partnerships for Impact
3. **Building Bridges:** Industrial Insights and Commercialization Exploration

All partnerships were forged in the spirit of iGEM's values, ensuring mutual benefit and a focus on solving real-world problems.

## Empowering the iGEM Community and Advancing Academia

We believe the strength of iGEM lies in its collaborative spirit. Acting as a hub for knowledge exchange, we engaged deeply with the global community and sought academic expertise to push the boundaries of our project.

### National Conferences: Synergy at Scale

#### The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai iGEM meet-up

We actively participated in this regional conference at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, which gathered more than 110 participants. This event was instrumental in aligning regional efforts, refining our project through feedback, and building a strong collaborative network in Eastern China.

#### Beijing CCiC &amp; Synbiopunk 2025

We attended this integrated event, which attracted over 1,000 synthetic biology researchers and developers globally. We presented our work in the [CCiC](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Khat--iWCXM0JxiwPnq1Ng) poster session and participated in SynCamp unconferences on critical topics like biosafety and AI. This experience provided invaluable feedback from both academic and industry perspectives, strengthening our commitment to responsible innovation.

## Activities Engagement &amp; Public Welfare

We actively sought collaborations with diverse teams to broaden our reach and engage wider audiences. We also extend our gratitude to the various departments and organizations that supported us and provided platforms for our activities.

### Expanding Reach through Regional and Digital Alliances

#### [SynbioSH](/education/#synbiosh)

Co-organized with teams from [ShanghaiTech-China](https://2025.igem.wiki/shanghaitech-china/) and [SJTU-BioX-Shanghai](https://2025.igem.wiki/sjtu-biox-shanghai/), this mega-event engaged 78 participants across Shanghai, transforming the city into a living laboratory and strengthening regional iGEM bonds.

</div>

#### [Rumor Clarification Handbook](/education/#rumor-stopping)

In collaboration with multiple universities, primarily [CJUH-JLU-China](https://2025.igem.wiki/cjuh-jlu-china/), we produced the "Smashing Synthetic Biology Rumors" [Science Brochure](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/collaboration/smashing-synthetic-biology-rumours-science-brochure-compressed.pdf), which participants could take home to continue practicing critical thinking when encountering health-related claims.


### Collaboration with Patient Groups and Medical Institutions

#### Flagship Partnership with the EB Community

We contacted a well-known EB patient blogger, ["Prince Superman"](https://www.douyin.com/user/MS4wLjABAAAAiPAi_DP-EC0vXnRdKEIiamC2FOLQPAVw9_-7_5n5uOxYFHlLwK9Bj0oKVI1SBqf9), getting in touch with the "Butterfly Baby" patient community was transformative. With [Chuangzhi Farm](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/T5r_cn4C996vpNrhgvPFFw), we organized an exhibition to help the public understand the daily challenges patients face.

## Summary

Our collaboration was guided by the principles of *serving project goals* and *empowering the iGEM community*. Through cross-team exchanges, expert guidance, and partnerships with schools, communities, patients, and industry, we co-created educational tools, organized public outreach, refined our project design, and explored real-world applications. Together, these collaborations bridged academia, society, and industry—transforming synthetic biology into a shared effort for education, empowerment, and innovation.
