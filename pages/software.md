## Problem Statement

Directed evolution through EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) mutagenesis is powerful but faces a key challenge: **how to control mutation rates in specific regions**. Researchers need to:
- **Maximize mutations** in target regions for library diversity
- **Minimize mutations** in critical functional domains to preserve protein function

**Current limitation**: No tools exist to rationally design sequences with tunable EMS sensitivity while maintaining protein identity.

## Our Solution

**EMS-Optimizer** intelligently selects synonymous codons to modulate G/C content, thereby controlling EMS mutation susceptibility. Key innovations:

1. **Dual modes**: Forward (G‚ÜíA, C‚ÜíT for EMS) and Reverse (A‚ÜíG, T‚ÜíC for suppressor screening)
2. **Risk-based algorithm**: Scores codons by stop/missense/silent mutation potential (not just G/C count)
3. **CAI integration**: Monitors translation efficiency impact using Codon Adaptation Index
4. **GFP specialization**: Built-in analysis for 22+ critical fluorescent protein sites
5. **Real-time visualization**: Interactive risk heatmaps with per-codon probability tooltips

## Key Features

### Intelligent Mutagenesis Design

At the core of our software is the **Smart Codon Selection** tool, which allows users to strategically target specific regions of a gene for mutagenesis. This feature operates in two distinct modes to suit different experimental goals. The **Maximize mode** is engineered to introduce high-risk codons into EMS-sensitive regions, thereby increasing the likelihood of desired mutations. Conversely, the **Minimize mode** selects low-risk codons for regions intended to remain stable. To quantify the potential impact of mutations, we have implemented a risk scoring system that heavily penalizes stop codons (√ó10) and missense mutations (√ó3) over silent mutations (√ó0). All codon selections are optimized for expression in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (yeast), ensuring that the resulting protein variants can be effectively produced.

The software supports two operational modes for modeling genetic changes. The default **G:C ‚Üí A:T Transition Mode** simulates the effects of EMS mutagenesis, specifically G‚ÜíA and C‚ÜíT transitions, which is ideal for standard mutagenesis screening experiments. For researchers interested in studying genetic suppression or reversion events, the **A:T ‚Üí G:C Transition Mode** models the corresponding reversion mutations (A‚ÜíG, T‚ÜíC), providing a powerful tool for identifying suppressor mutations and conducting reversion screening.

### Real-time Expression and Functional Analysis

To maintain a balance between mutagenesis and protein expression, our software includes **Translation Efficiency Tracking**. This feature calculates the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) in real-time as sequence modifications are made. Visual cues‚Äîa green indicator (üü¢) for an increase in CAI, red (üî¥) for a decrease, and white (‚ö™) for neutral changes‚Äîprovide immediate feedback, allowing users to make informed decisions that align their mutagenesis goals with optimal expression efficiency.

For projects focused on fluorescent protein engineering, the software offers a **GFP-Specific Analysis** module. This pre-configured tool is tailored for the analysis of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and its derivatives. It automatically identifies and tracks over 22 critical sites, including the essential chromophore core (Thr65-Tyr66-Gly67), key catalytic residues (Arg96, Glu222), and common color variants such as Y66H (BFP), Y66W (CFP), and T203Y (YFP). The analysis is weighted to prioritize these functionally significant residues, and reference sequences for EGFP and a yeast-optimized yEGFP are included for easy comparison.

### User-Friendly and Accessible

Our software is designed with the user in mind. As a web-based application, it requires no installation and is accessible from any modern web browser. It accommodates both DNA and protein sequences as input, with an automatic conversion feature for seamless workflow. The mutation rate is highly adjustable, with precision down to 1√ó10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞, giving users fine-grained control over their in-silico experiments. Once an optimized sequence is generated, it can be copied to the clipboard with a single click. To cater to a global user base, the interface is available in both English and Chinese.

### Risk Scoring Method

For each codon position (0, 1, 2):
1. **Identify mutable bases** (G/C for forward, A/T for reverse)
2. **Simulate mutation** (G‚ÜíA, C‚ÜíT, or A‚ÜíG, T‚ÜíC)
3. **Score outcome**:
   - Nonsense (stop codon): +10 points
   - Missense (AA change): +3 points
   - Silent (synonymous): 0 points
   - Base presence: +1 point
4. **Sum scores** across 3 positions

### Probability Calculation

**Per-codon probabilities**: Direct simulation of all 3 positions

**Sequence-wide cumulative probability**:
```
P(‚â•1 mutation) = 1 - ‚àè[1 - P(single codon)]
```
Implemented with log-space arithmetic for numerical stability:
```
P(‚â•1 mutation) = -expm1(‚àëlog1p(-P·µ¢))
```
