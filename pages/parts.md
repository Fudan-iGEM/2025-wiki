All of our level 0 plasmids (chloramphenicol resistance) were verified by Sanger sequencing (we attached electropherogram raw data as ab1 file with those parts), using one of the primers below.

<pre>U174_Kan-F      5-attctcaccggattcagt-3
U158_T7         5-taatacgactcactatagg-3
End-of-CmR      5-gcttaatgaattacaacagtactgcg-3
BR322ori-F      5-gggaaacgcctggtatcttt-3
t0terminator_R  5-ttcagaacgctcggttgcc-3</pre>

All of our [Golden Gate](/experiments.html#golden-gate-assembly) assembled plasmids, were verified by restriction enzyme digestion ([NotI](https://www.neb.com/en/products/r3189-noti-hf) or [HindIII](https://www.neb.com/en/products/r3104-hindiii-hf)) and whole-plasmid sequencing.

Our favourite parts are BBa_25
