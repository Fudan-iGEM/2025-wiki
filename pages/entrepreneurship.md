## Our pre-research: What's happening in the Antifungal medication market?

#### One:  Take a look at the business landscape


 According to Fortune Business Insights, the global antifungal drugs market size is projected to reach **USD** **13.17 billion by 2027**, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **3.3%** during the forecast period[1]. With our estimation,the chinese antifungal drugs market accounts for 25% of the global share (3.29 billion).

 Since the advent of echinocandins, the worsening drug resistance crisis has made the development of antifungal drugs with entirely new mechanisms an urgent global need. 

 Moreover, current fungal infection treatments still face the following challenges, contributing to a significant market demand for new antifungal drugs:

![The main causes of Antifungal  Drug Resistance](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic1.webp)

 In addition, the continuous growth of the elderly population, the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients are all closely linked to the high disease burden and demand for antifungal drugs within these target groups:

![High-Incidence Global Fungal Diseases in 2025](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic2.webp)

- According to a study published in the *Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection[2]*, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 face a significantly elevated risk of developing fungal respiratory infections. The incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) within the studied population ranged from 19.6% to 33.3%. Consequently, since 2021, there has been a sharp increase in demand for antifungal medications.
- Based on data updated in September 2022 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), onychomycosis (fungal infection of the fingernails and toenails) may affect up to 14% of the global population, with diabetic patients being particularly vulnerable. Among this group, dermatophytes (50%) and yeasts (30.8%) were identified as the most common cultured strains.

 While these factors underscore the rising strategic importance of antifungal drug development, it is necessary to examine **the practical process of antifungal drug** **R&D** in greater detail to better evaluate the market landscape and opportunities.

  

#### Two: why and who needs to study AMR ？

Currently, the preclinical R&D pipeline for antifungal drugs remains insufficiently robust. This is attributed to the lack of efficient and effective drug screening, which results in a relatively high attrition rate during early-stage drug innovation. Specifically, many drugs that appear promising in the preclinical phase fail in subsequent clinical trials due to various reasons, such as safety concerns and inadequate efficacy. The existing preclinical R&D pipeline is unable to offset the losses caused by these high attrition rates.

 Through our desk research, the R&D of a drug pipeline usually has five stages: Drug Discovery；Pharmaceutical Research；Preclinical Research；Clinical Trial；Approval and Marketing. AMR testing typically focuses on the phase of **pharmaceutical research.**

![The research process of an antifungal medication](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic3.webp)

 In this stage, CRO usually take the responsibility of drug screening for Drug manufacturers. CRO stands for Contract Research Organization，companies that provides outsourced research services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device firms. Therefore, they usually conduct specialized works including AMR tests that allow drug developers to reduce costs, accelerate timelines, and access specialized expertise without building everything in-house.

## Where our market is located: Unmet needs in the Yangtze Delta region

#### The gap in Critical Genetic Screening Approaches for Drug Resistance

 Currently, the escalation of fungal drug resistance and the lag in chassis organism models have led to a 24-year stagnation in the development of new classes of antifungal drugs.

 The root cause of the inability to address the drug resistance issue lies in the lack of suitable chassis organisms, specifically because existing models have flaws. Single-cell systems cannot simulate the drug-resistant behaviors of biofilms or fungal populations.

![The research process of an antifungal medication](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic7.webp)

 The prerequisite for developing anti-resistance drugs is the **precise identification of resistance mutation sites.** However, traditional whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is costly, analytically complex, and faces four major challenges: lack of standardization, resource dependency, high expense, and ambiguous results. Therefore, we aim to leverage our technology to develop a toolkit that can track the evolutionary dynamics of fungal resistance under drug pressure.

#### Benchhead market

![The research process of an antifungal medication](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic8.webp)

 Located in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, which includes Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, this area is a hub for China’s biopharmaceutical industry, housing key players like WuXi AppTec and numerous innovative drug developers. Our decision to focus on this region is driven by four key factors:

**Strong Industrial Cluster** The YRD region has developed a robust R&D cluster, particularly around Shanghai's Zhangjiang Medicine Valley and Suzhou BioBAY, which together represent 25% of China’s clinical-stage anti-fungal drug pipelines. Zhangjiang Medicine Valley supports a full industrial chain, including gene synthesis and preclinical validation. In 2024, the park’s technical transaction volume exceeded USD 210 million. We estimate an annual investment potential of USD 28 million in anti-fungal drug pipelines.

**Talent Pool** Led by Zhejiang University of Technology, the YRD Green Pharmaceutical Collaborative Innovation Center is supported by top-tier institutions such as Zhejiang University and the Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry. With 190 members, including 15 high-level talents, such as Chinese Academy of Engineering members and recipients of the National Outstanding Youth Fund, the center offers extensive expertise across pharmaceutical engineering, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology—key to advancing antifungal drug R&D.

**Expanding Market** East China is the primary growth engine for China's anti-infective drug market, valued at USD 6.8 billion in 2023 (36.7% of the national market). Projected to exceed USD 8.4 billion by 2025, it is growing at an 8.2% CAGR. The YRD region alone sees over 2.8 million annual dermatology outpatient visits, with a high density of pharmacies, providing a vast market for antifungal drug development.

**Policy Support** The YRD Pharmaceutical Industry Collaborative Development Plan prioritizes the establishment of joint R&D platforms for anti-infective drugs and accelerates regulatory processes for new antibiotics and antifungal drugs. To date, 4 Class 1 new drugs have been approved through priority review, enhancing the speed of antifungal drug R&D implementation.

 By embedding ourselves in this ecosystem, we will gain:

- Direct access to a concentrated customer base.

- Opportunities for strategic partnerships with leading CROs.

- A thriving talent pool for recruitment and collaborative research.

  

#### TAM, SAM, SOM Analysis

 **TAM Analysis** The Yangtze River Delta accounts for 39.7% of China’s antifungal resistance testing market. Given that the national fungal infection diagnostics market is projected to reach **USD 3.29 billion** by 2027, and assuming antifungal resistance testing represents **5%**, the total national market would be approximately **USD 164.5 million**. Based on the regional share, the TAM in the Yangtze Delta is about **USD 65.3 million**.

 **SAM Analysis** Our core target customers—CROs (70%) and research institutes/pharmaceutical R&D companies (30%)—represent **45%** of the market. Adjusting for geographic accessibility, where 20% of CROs remain difficult to reach, the SAM is estimated at **USD** **23.5 million**.

 **SOM** **Analysis** In the presence of established competitors, a new entrant with technical, pricing, or network advantages could reasonably capture **20%** of the SAM, resulting in a SOM of approximately **USD** **4.7 million**.

#### Pricing Strategy

![The research process of an antifungal medication](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic15.webp)

 With our understanding of stakeholders and YRD CRO / diagnostics kit markets, we will develop three suggested tiers for pricing.

| Package          | Contents                                                     | Suggested Price (USD) | Additional Notes                                             |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**        | Standard reagent kit (tree yeast strain + core probes), core software (fluorescence quantification, evolutionary modeling), manual, 3-month tech support | $18,000               | Lower margin for easier entry; potentially a subsidized/pilot price for early adopters; could include a consumable usage cap. |
| **Professional** | Adds customizable probes, advanced software features, priority technical support, potentially shorter training lead time | $28,000               | Intended for mid-sized CROs doing repeated studies, or labs needing more advanced metrics. |
| **Enterprise**   | Full probe customization, extended license (12 months+), higher usage volumes, potential onsite/bespoke modifications, premium support, software updates & modeling additions | $38,000 - $45,000     | May include "consumables per run" pricing or subscription components for software updates. |

 Additionally, we also planned pricing strategy ABC to engage our first consumers:

 **A. Consumables / Per-Sample Add-ons**: For labs / CROs not able to purchase full kits/licences upfront, you might offer per-sample reagents or per-run reagent bundles priced at e.g. **USD** **300-500 / sample** depending on complexity, or “run” pricing (batch) to make it more accessible.

 **B. Software License / Maintenance / Updates**: After initial sale, offer annual renewal/subscription for software updates / new models / cloud features in range **USD** **5,000-10,000/year** for Pro and Enterprise clients.

 **C. Discounts and Pilot Offers**: Early adopter discount (e.g. 10-20% off) for first few CRO clients in YRD in exchange for validation data / case studies.



#### Marketing Strategy

 **Target Segments**

- Primary: CROs in Yangtze River Delta (especially those doing antifungal drug development / resistance studies).
- Secondary: Hospital labs, diagnostic centers, academic research labs focusing on infectious disease / mycology.

 **Channels**

- Direct sales / business development to CROs in Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing etc.
- Collaborations with academic mycology / infectious disease departments in local universities.
- Conferences, workshops in China (biomed conferences) to promote proof-of-concept / case studies.

 **Partnerships**

- Partner with CROs for pilot studies.

- Possibly co-develop with diagnostic companies or reagent distributors for broader reach.

- Engage with government / public health labs for surveillance projects.

  

 **Regulatory / Compliance Strategy**

- Design product & validation to meet NMPA IVD standards; classify appropriately.

- Ensure quality systems (GMP / QC for reagents; software ISO / cybersecurity where needed).

  

 **Geographic Focus / Expansion**

 **Phase 1**: Yangtze River Delta — dense client base, efficient logistics.

 **Phase 2**: Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region

 **Phase 3**: Pearl River Delta (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau) 



 **Public relations**

 Core message

- Emphasize **real-time** **evolutionary dynamics** vs end-point measurement.
- Show **quantitative metrics**: mutation rates per locus; selection pressure under drug; generational mapping.
- Highlight **cost / time efficiency** vs WGS + downstream analysis.

 Campaigns

- Corporate Social Responsibility activities

 **Media channels**: 

- WeChat, official website, Rednote, targeted Chinese biotech media outlets.

  

#### IP Protection Strategy

 **Possible** **IP** **assets**

- Patents: key recombinant yeast strain with fluorescent clock + GPCR circuit; mutation probes; software algorithms (pMYTodeling, branch prediction, mutation rate computation).
- Trade secrets: specific probe designs / sequences; software source code; data from lineage tracking (unique datasets).
- Copyright / licensing: software, manuals, user interfaces.

 **Protection Actions**

- File patents in China and optionally in other key jurisdictions (e.g. USA, Europe) for core innovations (probes, yeast strain design, algorithmic modeling method).
- Use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs / NNN agreements) with partners and customers.
- Use copyright / license terms for software; possibly obfuscate or protect the software modeling part (copyright + possibly pat‐pending for significant algorithmic innovations).
- Monitor for infringement; have enforcement plan. Use China’s strengthening IP regime (WIPO, patent courts) to register and defend rights. WIPO data shows China has many PCT applications (70,000+ in 2024) and is emphasizing global IP layout.

 **Commercial** **IP** **Strategy**

- Licensing: for labs or CROs that prefer not to buy full kit, license software / probe use.
- Exclusive / co-exclusive agreements for high-volume clients.

  

#### Business Exit Strategy

We listed four possible exit paths for Dr.sTraTeGY: typically **5-6 years** from first commercial sales to either acquisition or IPO if all goes well (pMYTarket traction, regulatory compliance, scaling).

| Exit Path                                               | Description                                                  | Pros / Cons                                                  | Likely Valuation Drivers                                     |

**Exit Valuation Estimate**

| Metric                                 | Value / Multiple                          | Notes                                           |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Valuation Method**                   | Revenue Multiple                          | Based on biotech/diagnostics sector benchmarks. |
| **Typical Exit Multiple**              | **8x - 10x** Annual Revenue               | Depends on growth, visibility, and IP strength. |
| **Reference Data**                     | Avg: ~9.7x Revenue<br>Median Exit: ~$250M | Based on desk research in certain markets.      |
| **Scenario (Based on Year 5 Revenue)** |                                           |                                                 |
| Conservative (8x)                      | $32M - $48M                               |                                                 |
| Base Case (~9.7x)                      | $38.8M - $58.2M                           |                                                 |
| Optimistic (10x)                       | $40M - $60M                               |                                                 |

 So possible exit values at different revenue levels:

- If Year 4 revenue is USD ~2-3 million, exit might fetch USD ~16-30 million (if acquired).
- If by Year 5 revenue reaches ~USD 5-6 million with good margin, strong customer base, IP, then exit could be **USD 40-60 million** or more; with licensing, recurring revenue, or IPO, possibly higher.

 **Funding Needs & Use**

- Seed / Pre-Series A (USD 1-2 million) for pilot, regulatory, initial sales / hiring.
- Series A (USD 5-10 million) around Year 2-3 to scale production, marketing, expand geographic coverage.

 **Return for Investors**

- If exit in Year 4-5 at multiple revenues, investors in early rounds could see a 5-10× return, depending on dilution, growth.

  

## Our Action

 In March 2025, we participated in the National Innovation Competition, where we refined our business model and product presentation for the first time. 

 Later, in May 2025, we took part in the he Biopharmaceutical Track of the Shanghai College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition (Shanghai Stock Exchange Cup), aiming to raise initial funding from potential investors through roadshows. Industry experts and judges provided valuable feedback in discussion sessions—— for instance, experts recommended that we further segment our target customer groups in market sizing and strengthen the alignment of our product applications with clinical needs. Investors also highlighted the importance of early planning for intellectual property protection and building strong competitive barriers. Overall, these experiences sharpened our understanding of both our strengths and weaknesses, laying a solid foundation for product iteration, market expansion, and fundraising strategies in the future.

 In June 2025, we had the privilege of engaging in a face-to-face discussion with **Mr. Jie Chen, CEO of SoftBank China**. During the meeting, we presented the development concept, market positioning, and future roadmap of our core product, **DR.sTraTeGY**, highlighting its potential applications in antifungal resistance testing and drug discovery. Mr. Chen  emphasized the importance of establishing benchmark collaborations with CRO clients in the early stage to create demonstrative impact. He also reminded us to balance long-term capital planning with short-term cash flow management in our fundraising strategy. This exchange not only provided us with strategic insights from the investment community but also strengthened our confidence in driving the product toward industrialization.

 On September 18, our team held a constructive meeting with the iGEM team from East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) to discuss the commercialization plans of our respective projects. The dialogue covered business alignment, progress updates, and marketing strategies, while also clarifying each team's commercial focus and strategic logic.

 We introduced our multi-cellular yeast tracking tool, targeting CROs in the Yangtze River Delta, along with the designed yeast strains and software package. Our exit strategy involves licensing the toolkit to CROs by the fifth year.ECUST shared their project centered on gout prevention through functional food, aimed at easing the burden on healthcare and patients. They addressed challenges such as public skepticism toward functional products and safety concerns regarding engineered bacteria, highlighting outreach as key to gaining acceptance.

 Additionally, ECUST provided suggestions for our business plan, including:

1. Adding supporting data, patents, or authoritative certifications;
2. Including documents such as patent applications, after-sales guarantees, and user guides to enhance credibility;
3. Emphasizing favorable macro-trends and policy support;
4. Adhering to international standards to ensure safety and compliance.

 The exchange was insightful and beneficial for both teams.
