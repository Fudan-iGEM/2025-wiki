## 1. Pre-research: the Antifungal medication market

#### 1.1 Current business landscape


 According to Fortune Business Insights, the global antifungal drugs market size is projected to reach **USD** **13.17 billion by 2027**, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **3.3%** during the forecast period [^1]. With our estimation, the Chinese antifungal drugs market accounts for 25% of the global share (3.29 billion).

 Since the advent of echinocandins, the worsening drug resistance crisis has made the development of antifungal drugs with entirely new mechanisms an urgent global need. 

 Moreover, current fungal infection treatments still face the following challenges, contributing to a significant market demand for new antifungal drugs:

<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic1.webp" alt="The main causes of Antifungal  Drug Resistance" style="width:70%;" />

 In addition, the continuous growth of the elderly population, the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients are all closely linked to the high disease burden and demand for antifungal drugs within these target groups:

<img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic2.webp" alt="High-Incidence Global Fungal Diseases in 2025" style="width:70%;" />

- According to a study published in the Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection [^2], patients who have recovered from COVID-19 face a significantly elevated risk of developing fungal respiratory infections. The incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) within the studied population ranged from 19.6% to 33.3%. Consequently, since 2021, there has been a sharp increase in demand for antifungal medications.
- Based on data updated in September 2022 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), onychomycosis (fungal infection of the fingernails and toenails) may affect up to 14% of the global population, with diabetic patients being particularly vulnerable. Among this group, dermatophytes (50%) and yeasts (30.8%) were identified as the most common cultured strains [^3].

 While these factors underscore the rising strategic importance of antifungal drug development, it is necessary to examine **the practical process of antifungal drug** **R&D** in greater detail to better evaluate the market landscape and opportunities.

#### 1.2 The importance to study AMR

Currently, the preclinical R&D pipeline for antifungal drugs remains insufficiently robust. This is attributed to the lack of efficient and effective drug screening, which results in a relatively high attrition rate during early-stage drug innovation. Specifically, many drugs that appear promising in the preclinical phase fail in subsequent clinical trials due to various reasons, such as safety concerns and inadequate efficacy. The existing preclinical R&D pipeline is unable to offset the losses caused by these high attrition rates.

 Through our desk research, the R&D of a drug pipeline usually has five stages: Drug Discovery, Pharmaceutical Research, Preclinical Research, Clinical Trial, Approval and Marketing. AMR testing typically focuses on the phase of **pharmaceutical research.**

![The research process of an antifungal medication](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic3.webp)

 In this stage, CRO usually takes the responsibility of drug screening for Drug manufacturers. CRO stands for Contract Research Organization,  companies that provide outsourced research services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device firms. Therefore, they usually conduct specialized works including AMR tests that allow drug developers to reduce costs, accelerate timelines, and access specialized expertise without building everything in-house.

## 3. Discover:Unmet needs in the Yangtze Delta region

#### 3.1 The gap in Drug Target Discovery

 Currently, the escalation of fungal drug resistance and the lag in chassis organism models have led to a 24-year stagnation in the development of new classes of antifungal drugs.

 The root cause of the inability to address the drug resistance issue lies in the lack of suitable chassis organisms, specifically because existing models have flaws. Single-cell systems cannot simulate the drug-resistant behaviors of biofilms or fungal populations.

![The data for global drug resistance issues](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-issue.webp)

 The prerequisite for developing anti-resistance drugs is the **precise identification of resistance mutation sites.** However, traditional whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is costly, analytically complex, and faces four major challenges: lack of standardization, resource dependency, high expense, and ambiguous results. Therefore, we aim to leverage our technology to develop a toolkit that can track the evolutionary dynamics of fungal resistance under drug pressure.

#### 3.2 Benchhead market

![The research process of an antifungal medication](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5643/pageimage/entrepreneurship-image/igem-business-pic8.webp)

 Located in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, which includes Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, this area is a hub for China’s biopharmaceutical industry, housing key players like WuXi AppTec and numerous innovative drug developers. Our decision to focus on this region is driven by four key factors:

**Strong Industrial Cluster** The YRD region has developed a robust R&D cluster, particularly around Shanghai's Zhangjiang Medicine Valley and Suzhou BioBAY, which together represent 25% of China’s clinical-stage anti-fungal drug pipelines. Zhangjiang Medicine Valley supports a full industrial chain, including gene synthesis and preclinical validation. In 2024, the park’s technical transaction volume exceeded USD 210 million. We estimate an annual investment potential of USD 28 million in anti-fungal drug pipelines.

**Exit Valuation Estimate**

| Metric                                 | Value / Multiple                          | Notes                                           |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Valuation Method**                   | Revenue Multiple                          | Based on biotech/diagnostics sector benchmarks. |
| **Typical Exit Multiple**              | **8x - 10x** Annual Revenue               | Depends on growth, visibility, and IP strength. |
| **Reference Data**                     | Avg: ~9.7x Revenue<br>Median Exit: ~$250M | Based on desk research in certain markets.      |
| **Scenario (Based on Year 5 Revenue)** |                                           |                                                 |
| Conservative (8x)                      | $32M - $48M                               |                                                 |
| Base Case (~9.7x)                      | $38.8M - $58.2M                           |                                                 |
| Optimistic (10x)                       | $40M - $60M                               |                                                 |

 So possible exit values at different revenue levels:

- If Year 4 revenue is USD ~2-3 million, exit might fetch USD ~16-30 million (if acquired).
- If by Year 5 revenue reaches ~USD 5-6 million with good margin, strong customer base, IP, then exit could be **USD 40-60 million** or more; with licensing, recurring revenue, or IPO, possibly higher.

 **Funding Needs &amp; Use**

- Seed / Pre-Series A (USD 1-2 million) for pilot, regulatory, initial sales / hiring.
- Series A (USD 5-10 million) around Year 2-3 to scale production, marketing, expand geographic coverage.

 **Return for Investors**

- If exit in Year 4-5 at multiple revenues, investors in early rounds could see a 5-10x return, depending on dilution, growth.

  

## 7. Our Action

 In March 2025, we participated in the National Innovation Competition, where we refined our business model and product presentation for the first time. 

 Later, in May 2025, we took part in the **Biopharmaceutical Track of the Shanghai College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition (Shanghai Stock Exchange Cup),** aiming to raise initial funding from potential investors through roadshows. Industry experts and judges provided valuable feedback in discussion sessions—— for instance, experts recommended that we further segment our target customer groups in market sizing and strengthen the alignment of our product applications with clinical needs. Investors also highlighted the importance of early planning for intellectual property protection and building strong competitive barriers. Overall, these experiences sharpened our understanding of both our strengths and weaknesses, laying a solid foundation for product iteration, market expansion, and fundraising strategies in the future.

 In June 2025, we had the privilege of engaging in a face-to-face discussion with **Mr. Jie Chen, CEO of SoftBank China**. During the meeting, we presented the development concept, market positioning, and future roadmap of our core product, **DR.&nbsp;sTraTeGY**, highlighting its potential applications in antifungal resistance testing and drug discovery. Mr. Chen  emphasized the importance of establishing benchmark collaborations with CRO clients in the early stage to create demonstrative impact. He also reminded us to balance long-term capital planning with short-term cash flow management in our fundraising strategy. This exchange not only provided us with strategic insights from the investment community but also strengthened our confidence in driving the product toward industrialization.

 On September 18, our team held a constructive meeting with the iGEM team from **East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST)** to discuss the commercialization plans of our respective projects. The dialogue covered business alignment, progress updates, and marketing strategies, while also clarifying each team's commercial focus and strategic logic.

 We introduced our multi-cellular yeast tracking tool, targeting CROs in the Yangtze River Delta, along with the designed yeast strains and software package. Our exit strategy involves licensing the toolkit to CROs by the fifth year.ECUST shared their project centered on gout prevention through functional food, aimed at easing the burden on healthcare and patients. They addressed challenges such as public skepticism toward functional products and safety concerns regarding engineered bacteria, highlighting outreach as key to gaining acceptance.

 Additionally, ECUST provided suggestions for our business plan, including:

1. Adding supporting data, patents, or authoritative certifications;
2. Including documents such as patent applications, after-sales guarantees, and user guides to enhance credibility;
3. Emphasizing favorable macro-trends and policy support;
4. Adhering to international standards to ensure safety and compliance.

 The exchange was insightful and beneficial for both teams.
