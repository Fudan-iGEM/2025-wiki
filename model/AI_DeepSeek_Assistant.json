The protein expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1\n\n(for screening of Fast-FT) or 4 h (for screening of Medium-FT and Slow-FT). Then Fast-FT and\n\nMedium-FT libraries were screened using MoFlo (Dako) fluorescence activated cell sorter\n\n(FACS). In the case of Slow-FT library, the cells were pelletted down, resuspended in RM\n\nmedium supplemented with glucose, and FACS sorted 20 h later. For FACS sorting, the bacteria\n\nwere washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM\n\nNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and then diluted with PBS to optical density of 0.02\n\nat 600 nm. MoFlo cell sorter was equipped with Krypton, Argon, and Argon-Krypton mixed-gas\n\nlasers. For detection of the blue (450/65 nm filter), green (530/40 nm filter) and red (580 nm\n\nlongpass filter) fluorescence emissions, 407, 488 and 568 nm laser lines were used, respectively.\n\nTypically about 10 sizes of each library were screened. The collected brightest blue/non\ngreen/non-red bacterial cells were rescued in rich Super Optimal broth with Catabolite repression\n\n(SOC) medium at 37[0]C for several hours, and then were spread on 0.45 µm nitrocellulose\n\nmembranes placed on Petri dishes with Luria-Bertani medium (LB)/Ampicillin and incubated for\n\novernight at 37[0]C. Next morning the membranes were placed on Rich Medium (RM)/Ampicillin\n\nPetri dishes with 0.2% arabinose to induce protein expression. After incubation for 1 h (Fast-FT)\n\nor 4 h (Medium-FT) at 37[0]C, the brightest blue/non-green/non-red colonies were marked off\n\nusing Leica MZ16F fluorescence stereomicroscope equipped with custom blue (390/40 nm\n\nexciter, 460/40 nm emitter), green (480/40 nm exciter, 530/40 nm emitter), and red (570/30 nm\n\nexciter, 615/40 nm emitter) filter sets (Chroma). In the case of Slow-FT, additional 20 h of\n\nprotein maturation time were required to select the brightest blue/non-green/dim-red colonies. 1\n\nh (Fast-FT) or 4 h (Medium-FT and Slow-FT) after the start of the expression, the membranes\n\nwere placed on Petri dishes with RM/Ampicillin/0.2% glucose to repress the protein production.\n\nThen, 24 h (Fast-FT or Medium-FT) or 48 h (Slow-FT) later, the brightest red/non-blue/non\ngreen colonies among the previously marked clones were selected.\n\n**Protein purification.** To purify recombinant proteins, LMG194 cells grown overnight were\n\ndiluted to optical density 1.0 at 600 nm, and 0.2% arabinose was added for induction of protein\n\n===== Page 12 =====\n\nexpression. The bacterial cultures were then grown at 37[0]C in 50 ml tubes filled to the brim and\ntightly sealed to restrict oxygen supply. After 1 h, the cultures were pelleted down in the same\ntightly closed tubes. After opening the tubes, the proteins were purified using B-Per reagent\n(Pierce) and Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) within 15 min with all procedures and buffers at 4[0]C.\n\n**Insect and mammalian plasmid construction.** To make pRmHa-3-FTs plasmids, the PCR\namplified EcoRI-BamHI fragments encoding FTs were inserted into pRmHa-3 vector [21]. To\ngenerate LAMP-2A-FTs fusion proteins, the PCR-amplified Xhol-Agel fragments encoding FTs\nwere swapped with TSapphire-GFP in the pcDNA-3.1-LAMP-2A-TSapphire-GFP vector (gift of\nDr. D.Reeves). To make pTRE-FTs or pTRE-LAMP-2A-FTs plasmids, the PCR amplified\n_EcoRI-Xbal fragments encoding either FTs or LAMP-2A-FTs fusion proteins, respectively, were_\ninserted into pTRE vector (Clontech).\n\n**Transfection. Transfection of Drosophila S2 cells and all mammalian cells was carried out with**\nthe Effectene reagent (Qiagen). For microscopy imaging, HeLa, Cos-1, NIH3T3 or HeLa Tet-Off\ncells were plated on 25 mm glass coverslips in Dulbecco modified essential medium (DMEM)\n(Invitrogen) supplied with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma). S2 cells were cultured in\nSchnieder’s medium (Gibco) supplied with L-glutamine and 10% FBS (Sigma) at 25[0]C. To\nestablish stable pre-clonal cell cultures, pRmHa-3-FTs plasmids were co-transfected with\npCoBlast vector (Invitrogen) and selected with 25 µg/ml of blasticidin for 2 weeks.\n\n**Staining of cellular compartments in mammalian cells.** For staining of early and recycling\nendosomes with transferrin-Alexa 488, cells were washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM\nwithout FBS for 30 min at 37[0]C. After adding 50 µg/ml of transferrin-Alexa 488, cells were\nincubated at 4[0]C for 15 min before rinsing with PBS and further incubation in DMEM supplied\nwith 10% FBS for the next 20 min at 37[0]C. For staining of late endosomes and lysosomes, cells\nwere incubated with 100 nM of Lysotracker Green for 30 min at 37[0]C before imaging. For\nvisualization of Golgi network, HeLa Tet-Off cells were co-transfected with pTRE-LAMP-2AMedium-FT and pGalT-EYFP using 10:1 plasmid ratio.\n\n===== Page 13 =====\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Qasba, P.K., Ramakrishnan, B. & Boeggeman, E.

However, until recently, most synthetic\nbiology systems have focused on bacteria. While there is a wealth of resources and literature\nabout the biology of yeast, it can be daunting to navigate and extract the tools needed for\nengineering applications. Here we present a versatile engineering platform for yeast, which\ncontains both a rapid, modular assembly method and a basic set of characterized parts. This\nplatform provides a framework in which to create new designs, as well as data on promoters,\nterminators, degradation tags, and copy number to inform those designs. Additionally, we\ndescribe genome-editing tools for making modifications directly to the yeast chromosomes,\nwhich we find preferable to plasmids due to reduced variability in expression. With this\ntoolkit, we strive to simplify the process of engineering yeast by standardizing the physical\nmanipulations and suggesting best practices that together will enable more straightforward translation of materials and data from\none group to another. Additionally, by relieving researchers of the burden of technical details, they can focus on higher-level\naspects of experimental design.\nKEYWORDS: yeast, toolkit, characterized parts, golden gate, MoClo\nS\nynthetic biology is driven by the desire to engineer novel\nbiological functions that push the boundaries of what can\nbe accomplished within living cells. Unfortunately, the potential\npower of the cell also brings with it a level of complexity that\nmakes engineering biological systems extremely difficult.\nSynthetic biologists have sought ways to abstract the layers of\ncomplexity into components with predictable interactions,\nmaking it more feasible to undertake large engineering projects.\nDespite these efforts, the inner workings of the cell continue to\nelude understanding, and while certain elements can be highly\npredictable, the system behavior as a whole is difficult to\nanticipate. These challenges have led to an additional, and\nequally important, aspect to synthetic biology: rapid prototyp-\ning.1−4 Because manipulations to the cell often lead to\nunexpected results, progress is best made by rapidly iterating\nthrough highly parallelized experiments to explore a wide\nparameter space.5,6 It is the combination of these two\nprinciplespredictable parts and rapid prototypingthat\ngive synthetic biologists the ability to approach difficult\nproblems in energy,7,8 agriculture,9 and human health.10−12\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is growing in popularity as a chassis for\nsynthetic biology due to its powerful genetic tools,13−15\nextensively studied biology,16−19 and long history of industrial\napplications.20−22 In this work, we present a synthetic biology\ntoolkit for engineering yeast that simplifies and accelerates\nexperimentation in this important model organism.\nAbstraction is a fundamental principle in any engineering\ndiscipline. It allows an engineer to focus on an individual\ncomponent with the assurance that it will interface correctly\nwith other components, both existing and future. When applied\nto synthetic biology, abstraction typically refers to the level of\ncomplexity of the DNA that is being built or introduced into\ncells. “Parts” are often thought of as one of the most basic DNA\nsequence elements that can be assigned a function. For\nexample, a coding sequence, a transcriptional terminator, and\nan origin of replication could all be described as parts. Although\nthese parts can be broken down furtherthey contain, among\nother things, a start and stop codon, a hairpin, and a protein\nbinding site, respectivelythe benefit of abstraction is the\nability to ignore those lower level details and work with a part\nbased solely on its reported function. Extensive efforts by others\nin the field have contributed to the Registry of Standard\nBiological Parts, a catalog of DNA sequences and character-\nization data that continues to grow each year (http://\npartsregistry.org).23 The Registry, however, is notably biased\ntoward working in bacterial systems, particularly Escherichia coli,\nand with growing interest in yeast as a synthetic biology host, it\nis becoming apparent that the field needs a more extensive set\nof standard yeast parts. For this toolkit, we collected,\nReceived:\nDecember 19, 2014\nPublished: April 14, 2015\nResearch Article\npubs.acs.org/synthbio\n© 2015 American Chemical Society\n975\nDOI: 10.1021/sb500366v\nACS Synth.

The lag between having a DNA design and actually obtaining the physical DNA is far too long to support a robust prototyping workflow. The solution that many groups have developed is standardization of cloning.\\(^{27-33}\\) For example, the BioBrick standard (and its relatives) defines a set of restriction enzymes sites that are used to flank each part in a vector.\\(^{27,30}\\) When those restriction enzymes are used to join two parts, the junction contains an assembly “scar”, and the resulting plasmid reconstitutes the sites external to the newly combined parts (an idempotent operation). This enables an endless number of cycles of pairwise assembly. More recently, Golden Gate assembly based methods have increased in popularity due to the added flexibility provided by the use of Type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside their recognition sequence and provide unique cohesive ends to enable directional, multi-insert, one-pot cloning.\\(^{33}\\) One example is the MoClo (modular cloning) system, which categorizes parts as “types” based on their function and location in a completed device (_e.g.,_ promoter types or coding sequence types) and designates particular overhangs that flank each type, allowing all parts of a particular type to be interchangeable.\\(^{32}\\) In this work, we adapted the MoClo strategy specifically to build yeast expression devices. The major advantage of using a standardized system such as MoClo is that once parts are constructed, they are immediately available for incorporation into devices and no longer require synthesis of oligonucleotides, PCR amplification and purification, or verification by sequencing. This allows us to construct from parts, a plasmid carrying multiple gene expression devices in as little as 2 days.\n\n■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nDefinition of an Assembly Standard for Yeast. Our standard for assembling DNA for expression in yeast is a bottom-up hierarchical approach to DNA construction (Figure 1). A description of the assembly scheme, part types, and overhang sequences are discussed briefly here and in more detail in the Supporting Information. For brevity, Golden Gate assemblies using either Baal or BsmBI are referred to as “Baal assembly” and “BsmBI assembly”.\n\nOur workflow for assembling complex plasmids for expressing multiple genes in yeast has multiple steps that correspond to our abstraction layers. First, source DNA is obtained through PCR, synthesis or another user-preferred method. That source DNA is “domesticated” via BsmBI assembly into a universal entry vector, resulting in a “part” plasmid. Part plasmids come in different Types, numbered 1 through 8 (with some optional subtypes). Each part Type is defined by the sequences of the upstream and downstream flanking overhangs generated when digested by Baal. All parts of a particular Type are interchangeable, which lends the system well to combinatorial experiments. Part plasmids are joined in a Baal assembly to form a “cassette” plasmid that, in most cases, is used to express a single gene in yeast (a transcriptional unit, TU, comprised of a promoter, coding sequence, and terminator). These cassettes can optionally be joined in a final BsmBI assembly to form “multi-gene” plasmids that, as the name suggests, are used to simultaneously express multiple genes. The multigene assembly is enabled by the use of Assembly Connectors (Type 1 and 5) that, in similar fashion to each part plasmid’s unique Baal overhangs, contain unique BsmBI overhangs that flank each cassette. At each round of assembly, the antibiotic selection is changed to minimize background (typically, chloramphenicol → ampicillin → kanamycin). Using this workflow, we can construct a multigene plasmid from PCR templates in only 3 days. This construction time is typically reduced to only 2 days, since, in most cases, the final multigene plasmids are built from existing parts.\n\nThere are many benefits to the standard we defined, which should prove useful to synthetic biologists with a wide range of needs. First, the cloning protocols are extremely simple, requiring no PCR amplification or purification steps after the initial part creation. Second, the standardized Golden Gate assemblies are highly robust. It was previously shown that for a 10-part assembly with an optimized set of overhangs, 97% of isolated transformations contained a correctly assembled\n\nA.

Note that the eight primary part Types can be further divided into subtypes (\\( e.g., 3a/3b \\)), or combined to make composite types (\\( eg, 234 \\)). Each Type has a unique upstream and downstream overhang pair, and a complete cassette can be assembled when a complete path can be drawn from left to right (\\( 1\\) to \\( 8 \\)). For example, the preassembled integration vector is assembled from ConLS’ (\\( 1 \\)), GFP dropout (\\( 234 \\)), ConRE’ (\\( 5 \\)), URA3 (\\( 6 \\)), URA3 3’ Homology (\\( 7 \\)), KanR-CoIE1 (\\( 8a \\)), and URA3 5’ Homology (\\( 8b \\)). A transcriptional unit (promoter, coding sequence, terminator) can be assembled into this vector, replacing the Baal-flanked GFP dropout. A set of cassettes can also be assembled into this vector, due to the special Assembly Connectors ConLS’ and ConRE’ that have the BsmBI recognition sites in the reverse orientation (Supporting Information). The part plasmid entry vector is used for constructing new parts. A table of plasmid names, parts, and Types is included in Supporting Table S1.\n\nplasmid.\\(^{34}\\) We observed comparable efficiencies in this work and screened only one transformation for almost all plasmid assemblies described here. Because PCR- and oligonucleotide-derived point mutations cannot occur after the construction of part plasmids, we do not typically sequence downstream assemblies and instead use simple restriction mapping to verify size. Third, our workflow supports a simple method for chromosomal integration in which plasmids designed for integration can be transformed directly after being linearized via a Notl digestion.\\(^{35}\\) Fourth, our design specification includes unique restriction enzyme sites that make cassettes both BioBrick- and BglBrick-compatible, and multigene plasmids BioBrick-compatible. While a variety of restriction sites (BamHI, BbsI, BglII, BsaI, BsmBI, EcoRI, Notl, PstI, Spel, XbaI, and Xhol) have been removed from all parts in the toolkit for increased flexibility, only BsaI, BsmBI, and Notl must be removed from new parts to conform to the complete assembly scheme described here. Finally, the Assembly Connectors, in addition to harboring BsmBI sites, can also act as homology sequences for recombination-based cloning, such as sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC),\\(^{36}\\) Gibson assembly,\\(^{37,38}\\) ligase cycling reaction (LCR),\\(^{39}\\) or yeast in vivo assembly,\\(^{40}\\) if those methods are preferred.\n\n**A Toolkit of Yeast Parts.** Although an assembly standard has some inherent value, its utility is determined in large part by the availability of parts.

(C) Galactose induction of pGAL1 increases expression from background levels up to the highest expressing constitutive promoter, pTDH3. All solid line data were collected from a Agal2 strain. The dashed line shows a much more sensitive response to galactose induction in a wild type strain. Points represent the median value of four biological replicates, and error bars show the range.\n\ncollection of 96 parts compatible with this standard for efficiently engineering yeast strains (Figure 2 and Supporting Table S1). This starter collection contains an assortment of promoters, terminators, fluorescent proteins, peptide tags, selectable markers, and origins of replication, as well as a part entry vector into which new parts can be cloned. Additionally, we have included sequences targeting chromosomal loci for integration, and genome-editing tools for introducing double-strand breaks to stimulate homologous recombination. Finally, rather than provide a large array of different vectors, the assembly standard enables construction of custom vectors directly from parts in the toolkit, and one such vector is included as an example (Supporting Information).\n\nCharacterization of Promoters. We have characterized 19 constitutive promoters, two mating-type-specific promoters, and two inducible promoters, all cloned from the yeast genome (although synthetic promoters\\(^{4-7}\\) could easily be ported into the system as well). The promoters were selected to span a wide range of transcriptional strengths while minimizing variability between growth conditions.\\(^{43}\\) In general, they constitute the 700 bp directly upstream of the native start codon, although in some cases where another ORF was less than 700 bp away, we cloned only the intergenic noncoding region. To examine the strength of each promoter, we cloned it upstream of a fluorescent reporter (mRuby2, Venus, and mTurguoise2) and measured bulk fluorescence on a plate reader.\n\nIt was previously shown that the strength of constitutive promoters cloned from the yeast genome was largely independent of the downstream coding sequence,\\(^{44}\\) an important distinction between controlling expression in bacteria and yeast. This held true for the 19 constitutive promoters characterized in this work (which include some overlap with Lee et al., 2013)\\(^{44}\\) (Figure 3A and Supporting Figure S1). The promoters span a range of up to 3 orders of magnitude, and there are also some promoters that have very similar expression strengths, allowing them to be interchanged so as to reduce the risk of undesired homologous recombination in multigene plasmids due to repeated sequences. Although we only tested these promoters in one type of media, the majority of native yeast promoters have been shown to maintain their relative expression strengths in different growth conditions, although the absolute strengths may change.\\(^{45}\\)\n\nIt is sometimes useful to have genes under dynamic control, and for this we provide two tools: mating-type-specific and inducible promoters. We tested pMFA1 and pMFa2 and found that they have very close to background levels of fluorescence\n\n978\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500566v\nACS Synth. Biol. 2015, 4, 975–986\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology\n\nFigure 4. Characterization of terminators. Six terminators were cloned behind three fluorescent proteins, each driven by three promoters. The relative expression levels for this set of terminators are largely independent of the coding sequence and the promoter. The height of the bars represents the median value of four biological replicates, and the error bars show the range.\n\nin both the opposite mating-type haploid and diploid strains and a 6- to 10-fold induction in the appropriate haploid (Figure 3B). We also tested pGAL1 in varying concentrations of galactose and observed a 100-fold induction (Figure 3C). Although the promoter can be used in wild-type strains, the response is very sensitive to low concentrations of galactose; a strain with the GAL2 transporter knocked out should be used for more graded control overexpression.\\(^{46}\\) Finally, we tested pCUP1 in varying concentrations of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO\\(_4\\)) and observed a 55-fold induction (Supporting Figure S2). This promoter exhibits leaky expression under basal conditions, with approximately 7-fold fluorescence over background when CuSO\\(_4\\) is not added to the media. This may be due in part to the CuSO\\(_4\\) that is present at 250 nM in the yeast nitrogen base commonly used to make defined media.\n\nCharacterization of Terminators. The impact of different transcriptional terminators on gene expression can vary considerably, and could provide a secondary mode of control to complement the promoters. However, for simplicity, we opted in this toolkit to provide terminators that yielded approximately the same expression output. Using expression data from the whole yeast genome,\\(^{43}\\) we selected six of the most highly expressed genes and cloned the 225 bp immediately downstream of the stop codon. We assembled these terminators with each of our three fluorescent reporters and each using three promoters. The largest difference in expression we observed between terminators for a given promoter and fluorescent protein was 36-fold (Figure 4). In general, the fold-changes produced by different promoters were greater than those effected by the terminators, but this was not always the case. If applications are sensitive to small fold-changes of expression, we advise characterizing individual promoter-terminator pairs to ensure that the desired levels of expression are obtained.\n\nProtein Degradation Tags. In addition to controlling transcript levels, protein levels can be tuned by fusing degradation tags to the N-terminus. We have included three such tags of varying strengths, Ubi-M (weak), Ubi-Y (medium), and Ubi-R (strong), which can be used to adjust the rate of protein turnover.\\(^{47}\\) We fused these tags to the N-terminus of mRuby2, and expressed them using a strong, moderate, and weak promoter, pTDH3, pRPL18B, and pREV1, respectively. The strong degradation tag (Ubi-R) resulted in no detectable fluorescence at any expression level, while the medium strength degradation tag (Ubi-Y) resulted in detectable levels of fluorescence at only the highest expression level (Figure 5).\n\nCopy Number, Gene Expression, and Single-Cell Variability. When engineering yeast strains expressing multiple heterologous proteins, it is important to consider the relative expression of those proteins. As described above, protein levels can be controlled by changing promoters, terminators, or degradation rates. However, another important consideration is the copy number of the gene(s). Typically, one of three systems is used to express genes in yeast: single-copy integrations into the chromosome, low-copy CEN6/ARS4 plasmids, and high-copy 2micron plasmids. One could easily assume that the differences in copy number simply titrate gene expression accordingly, but we observed that there are subtle, but important, effects that could influence the decision to use one system over another.\n\nWe cloned cassettes expressing either mRuby2 or Venus under strong, moderate, and weak promoters (pTDH3, pRPL18B, and pREV1, respectively). Versions of these cassettes were made for each of the three copy numbers. Finally, each of the nine possible combinations of the three promoters and two genes were either assembled in tandem onto a single chromosomal locus/plasmid or kept separate in two loci/plasmids. We measured bulk fluorescence of both fluorescent proteins to compare protein expression levels of the cell populations at the three copy-numbers (Figure 6 and Supporting Figure S3).\n\nIn the chromosomally integrated strains, the different promoter combinations fill out the points of a regular grid, as expected. In the low-copy CEN6/ARS4 plasmid system, the absolute fluorescence is generally higher compared to the\n\nFigure 5. Protein degradation tags. Three N-terminal degradation tags were fused to mRuby2 and expressed using three different promoters. Steady-state fluorescence levels are dependent on the difference between the strength of the promoter and the strength of the degradation tag. The height of the bars represents the median value of six biological replicates, and the error bars show the range.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500906\n979 ACS Synth. Biol. 2015. 4, 975–986\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology\n\nVenus fluorescence (fold over background)\n\nFigure 6. Effect of copy number on gene expression. Three promoters \\( pTDH3, pRPL18B, and pREV1 \\) drive two fluorescent proteins (mRuby2 and Venus) in all nine possible combinations. These nine combinations are integrated into the chromosome (blue), expressed from a low-copy plasmid (green), and expressed from a high-copy plasmid (red). The translucent, shaded boxes show the range of expression spanned by each respective copy number. For lower strength promoters, increasing copy number gives higher fluorescence; but for the strongest promoter, there is a much smaller difference between the low- and high-copy plasmids. Each gene is integrated in a separate locus or expressed from a separate plasmid. The horizontal and vertical bars represent the range of four biological replicates, and the intersection represents the median value.\n\nchromosome, again, as expected. Interestingly, the range between the highest and lowest expression is actually slightly greater in the CENG/ARS4 plasmid system. Compared to low-copy plasmids, the high-copy 2micron plasmids showed considerably more irregular expression patterns. In the two-plasmid, 2micron system, the grid is preserved, but compressed at higher expression levels, suggesting that some expression machinery in the cell is limiting and that having more copies of the DNA has little effect on increasing expression; i.e., the average fluorescence of cells with the strongest promoter is similar between low- and high-copy plasmids. In the single-plasmid, 2micron system, not only is the grid compressed, but also it appears that high expression of one gene seems to reduce the expression of the second gene (Supporting Figure S3). On the basis of flow cytometry, there appears to be a bimodal distribution for some of these populations (Figure 7C, e.g., \\( pTDH3-mRuby2/pRPL18B-Venus \\)), which is consistent with previous studies comparing the distribution of expression in 2micron and chromosomally integrated systems.\\(^{48}\\) Interestingly, this effect is not nearly as pronounced in the chromosome or on the low-copy plasmid. It is unclear why this would be specific to the high-copy plasmid. On the basis of these data, we believe that use of high-copy 2micron plasmids should generally be avoided, since the highest expression levels accessible by them are very nearly accessible by low-copy CENG/ARS4 plasmids, and low-copy plasmids give greater access to lower expression, and in general have less erratic expression patterns.\n\nAnother parameter we examined was cell-to-cell variability in the relative expression of two genes. While it has been shown that strains expressing fluorescent proteins from chromosomally integrated genes display much tighter distributions compared to those expressing from 2micron plasmids,\\(^{48}\\) we were curious about any additional effects of propagating one versus multiple plasmids. We took the same cultures used to measure bulk fluorescence and ran them on a flow cytometer to measure single-cell fluorescence of the two fluorescent proteins (Figure 7). As expected, the single-cell measurements revealed that the variability in fluorescence increased considerably when moving from the chromosome to either a low-copy or high-copy plasmid, indicating that the precise copy number of these plasmids is not tightly regulated. When expressed from a single locus/plasmid, the expression of the two fluorescent proteins\n\nFigure 7. Effect of copy number on single-cell gene expression. The same strains expressing mRuby2 and Venus that measured for bulk fluorescence in Figure 6 and Supporting Figure S3 were run on a flow cytometer: chromosomally integrated in a single locus (A) or two loci (D); on a single (B) or two (E) low-copy plasmids; on a single (C) or two (F) high-copy plasmids. As copy number increased, the variability of expression also increased. For all single-locus strains, the expression of the two fluorescent proteins was well correlated, suggesting that copy number is the main contributor to variation in expression. When expressed from two plasmids, correlation between fluorescent proteins is lost, suggesting that the copy number of each plasmid is independent of the other. Fluorescence in each channel was normalized for cell size by dividing by forward-scatter. Dot plots for each sample represent 5000–10000 events.\n\n980\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500366v\nACS Synth. Biol. 2015, 4, 975–986\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology Research Article\n\nwas well correlated, as evidenced by the distribution of each strain along the diagonal. This result suggests that DNA copy number is the primary source of added variation in plasmid-based expression systems, a model which is further supported by the data from two loci/plasmids. Strains expressing mRuby2 and Venus from two separate loci in the chromosome showed distributions that are nearly identical to the single locus, chromosomal strains. In contrast, the low-copy and high-copy plasmids lose their tight correlation between the two fluorescent proteins when the two genes are expressed from separate plasmids. Thus, not only is the copy number of a plasmid highly variable, the relative copy numbers of two plasmids in the same cell are not well correlated. Therefore, we would recommend that genes be integrated into the chromosome whenever possible. If, however, higher expression than can be attained from the chromosome is required, use of a low-copy plasmid is preferred, and all genes should be expressed from the same plasmid rather than split onto multiple plasmids. Accordingly, the assembly standard we provide here accommodates the facile assembly of up to six genes on a single plasmid or in a single chromosomal locus, with more possible if additional Assembly Connectors are designed.\n\nHigh-Efficiency Integrations into the Chromosome. Yeast is well suited to chromosomal modification due to its efficient homologous recombination machinery. This allows for site-specific integration of DNA into the chromosome by simply transforming linear DNA flanked by sequences homologous to the target locus. However, compared to plasmid transformation, integrations usually result in almost an order of magnitude reduction in colony counts, which is one reason why the use of plasmids is often preferred. Given the desire for chromosomal integrations described earlier, it is evident that a higher efficiency method for integrating into the chromosome is necessary, particularly when working with large libraries. Fortunately, it was previously shown that transformation efficiency could be dramatically improved by using a homing endonuclease to generate a double-strand break in the chromosome and stimulate recombination.\\(^{49}\\) More recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has been used for similar purposes.\\(^{50-52}\\) We tested both systems to directly compare their effects on chromosomal library construction.\n\nFirst, we prepared an experimental strain by integrating a \"landing pad\" using conventional homologous recombination of linear DNA (Supporting Figure S4A). This landing pad contained an I-Scel recognition site; the I-Scel recognition site conveniently contains an NGG protospaer adjacent motif (PAM) close to the I-Scel cutting site, and we added an extra 10 bp upstream of the site to create a 20 bp targeting sequence for a single guide RNA (sgRNA); we also included a partial URA3 coding sequence and terminated that by itself is nonfunctional.\n\nNext, we designed the repair DNA we were integrating to contain a Venus-expressing cassette and a HIS3-expressing cassette, flanked by homology to the sequence upstream of the landing pad and to the partial URA3 marker. Thus, when the DNA integrated successfully, the cells would be prototrophic for histidine and uracil, and they would be fluorescent. If the DNA integrated off-target, the cells would be prototrophic for histidine and fluorescent, but they would remain auxotrophic for uracil, allowing us to measure the rate of off-target integration by selecting on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA).\n\nFinally, we compared the efficiency of integration when the repair DNA was transformed unassisted, with a transient \"cutter\" plasmid (we did not select for it) expressing Cas9 and an sgRNA, or with a transient cutter plasmid expressing I-Scel. As a control for cell competency, we transformed a circular version of the repair DNA that also contained an origin of replication (Figure 8 and Supporting Figure S4B). Compared to the plasmid transformation, unassisted integration gave approximately 6-fold fewer colonies. When a CRISPR/Cas9 cutter plasmid was cotransformed, there was a 2-fold increase in colony count over unassisted integration; when an I-Scel cutter plasmid was cotransformed, there was an additional 2.5-fold increase (5-fold compared to unassisted). We were able to further improve the efficiency for both the Cas9 and I-Scel systems by linearizing (with a restriction digest) the cutter plasmid prior to transformation. Doing so brought the efficiency of Cas9-assisted integration to match that of plasmid transformation. Incredibly, the linearized I-Scel-expressing DNA actually increased integration efficiency to 1.8-fold over the rate of plasmid transformation. We measured the rate of off-target integration for this most efficient method (linearized I-Scel) and found that only 0.02% of transformants were 5-FOA resistant, and therefore had integrated the repair DNA improperly. By measuring Venus fluorescence, we found that 0.14% of transformants contained multiple integrations. It is unclear why linearizing the cutter plasmid increases the transformation efficiency, but one possibility is that linear DNA enters the cell and/or nucleus more efficiently than circular plasmids. Regardless, the ease with which sequences\n\nFigure 8: High-efficiency integration into the chromosome. Integration of linear DNA into the chromosome by homologous recombination yields 6-fold fewer colonies (compare shaded bars). Adding in a Cas9 or I-Scel improves transformation efficiency by 2-fold and 5-fold, respectively (compare white bars to unassisted integration). Linearizing the Cas9 or I-Scel expression plasmid prior to transformation further improves transformation efficiency to match plasmid transformation efficiency or exceed it by 1.8-fold, respectively (compare striped bars to plasmid transformation). Colony counts are normalized to the number of colonies from the plasmid transformation for each replicate. The height of the bars represents the mean value of three biological replicates, and the error bars show the standard error of the mean.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500906\n981 ACS Synth. Biol. 2015, 4, 975–986\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology\n\ncan now be integrated into the chromosome should further encourage the use of integrations over plasmids, even with the high transformation efficiency requirements when working with large libraries.\n\nMultiplex, Markerless Genome Editing Using CRISPR/ Cas9. Although the high-efficiency integration method described above is very powerful for integrating sequences into the chromosome, it requires a selectable marker be present in the integrated DNA. There are some cases where this requirement is undesirable, such as knocking out multiple genes in a single strain. In this case, a unique marker is needed for each locus; markers must be introduced and then removed for each sequential knockout; or complex mating and screening strategies have to be used to collect all the mutants in a single strain. To avoid these tedious procedures, we adapted the recently described CRISPRm method for making multiple genome edits simultaneously.\\(^{51}\\)\n\nFirst, we designed two sgRNAs to target each of four genes—LEU2, HIS3, MET15, and TRP1—and repair DNAs (PCR products with 60 bp of homology flanking a 20 bp barcode, see Supporting Figure SSA, Supporting Table S2, and Supporting Table S3) that target those loci and introduce a premature stop codon. We assembled each sgRNA onto a CENG/AR54 plasmid containing a Cas9 expression cassette with a UR43 marker (Supporting Figure SSB). We then transformed each plasmid with or without its cognate repair DNA and selected for transformations on synthetic media lacking uracil (Figure 9A and 9B, and Supporting Figure SSC). For seven out of eight guides, the transformations with repair DNA had over 100-fold more colonies than those without repair DNA. This large difference in colony yields suggests that when Cas9 successfully targets a locus in the genome, the double-strand break it introduces is toxic to the cell; when a repair DNA is present, it removes the target and abolishes the toxicity caused by Cas9. Thus, selecting for the Cas9 plasmid indirectly selects for repairs to the genome at the targeted locus. It should be noted that both here and elsewhere,\\(^{51,52}\\) it has been shown that the effectiveness of sgRNAs at targeting is variable, and so we recommend that multiple guides be tested until more robust design rules have been determined.\n\nNext, to test multiplexed knockouts, we assembled guides in tandem on a single plasmid with Cas9, targeting one, two, three, or all four loci at once. The standardization and modularity of our assembly scheme made the construction of these multitargeting plasmids straightforward. We transformed these plasmids, again, with or without their cognate repair DNAs, and selected on synthetic media lacking uracil. We picked 40 colonies into different dropout media to determine the fraction of transformants that had the correct phenotype (auxotrophy). Consistent with results from Ryan et al.,\\(^{51}\\) as the number of simultaneous targets increased, the fraction of correct transformants decreased, but it was still possible to disrupt all four targets at once with ~20% efficiency (Figure 9C). One possible cause of this decrease in efficiency could be recombination within the Cas9 plasmid that excises one or more guides, which could be minimized by using different promoters for each guide, but this has not been tested. Although the intention here is loss-of-function disruptions, only assaying for phenotype does not demonstrate the rate of correct repair DNA incorporation, as a nonhomologous end joining could also result in a disruption. To assay this, we screened six (three from each replicate) phenotypically correct colonies for each transformation by colony PCR. For the single, double, and triple knockouts, all six colonies were correct, and for the quadruple knockout, four out of six were correct.\n\nIn addition to disrupting genes, this same strategy could be used to integrate large constructs in a markerless fashion or to introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In cases where SNPs do not completely disrupt sgRNA targeting, two rounds of editing can be performed. The first round sgRNA should target the endogenous sequence, and the repair DNA should destroy the target and/or PAM by introducing a temporary, orthogonal sequence. The second round sgRNA should target the newly introduced sequence, and the repair DNA should reintroduce the endogenous sequence with the desired SNP. Although the same could be accomplished using a counterselectable marker such as UR43, using CRISPRm allows for multiple modifications to be made at once.\n\nSummary. We have described a methodology and an accompanying toolkit of essential parts for engineering yeast. This MoClo-derived assembly standard supports the rapid cloning of multigene expression devices. We characterized a set of promoters and terminators, which are by no means exhaustive or perfect, but nonetheless diverse, in order to support the construction of multigene plasmids with minimal risk of unwanted homologous recombination. As a distinct method of controlling protein concentration, degradation tags are also characterized. Additionally, we have illustrated an important difference between using plasmids and chromosomal integrations and encourage expression from the chromosome whenever possible. To facilitate this, our system is designed to\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{target} & \\text{logit targeted} & \\text{LEU2} & \\text{LEU2, HIS3} & \\text{LEU2, HIS3, MET15} & \\text{LEU2, HIS3, MET15, TRP1} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{fraction correct phenotype} & 3940 & 3840 & 3640 & 2640 & 2340 & 3040 & 1140 & 640 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{number of transformants} & 110,000 & 90,000 & 8,000 & 3,000 & 1,200 & 575 & 212 & 70 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{fraction of correct phenotype with correct genotype} & 798 & 779 & 107 & 108 & 250 & 110 & 61 & 53 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{total exposure} & 33 & 33 & 33 & 33 & 33 & 33 & 23 & 23 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nFigure 9. Multiplex, markerless knockouts. A plasmid expressing Cas9 and an sgRNA that targets the LEU2 locus was transformed with (A) or without (B) a repair DNA that introduces a stop codon and destroys the sgRNA target. Shown are transformations placed on synthetic media lacking uracil, which selects only for the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid. Thus, selecting for the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid indirectly selects for cells that repaired the locus. (C) Multiple loci were targeted simultaneously, and 40 colonies each from two independent experiments were screened for the appropriate phenotype (auxotrophy). The raw number of colonies with and without repair is also shown to demonstrate that both the number of transformants and the fraction of correct clones decrease with an increasing number of targets. Finally, three colonies with the correct phenotype were then screened by colony PCR to verify proper integration of the repair DNA.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10509-0066-4\nACS Synth.

We also present two options, using I-Scel or CRISPR/Cas9, for generating double-stranded breaks in the chromosome that increase integration efficiencies to match or even exceed that of plasmid transformations. Finally, we adapted the CRISPR method to our standardized assembly scheme to enable multiplexed knockouts of endogenous genes. In summary, we believe this work will be a useful resource for both novice and experienced yeast biologists and engineers, and lays the foundation for a community that shares novel parts, as well as leads to greater consistency and reproducibility.\n\n■ METHODS\nStrains and Growth Media. The S. cerevisiae strain used for measuring most promoters, terminators, degradation tags, copy number, and chromosomal integrations was BY4741 (MATa his3A1 leu2A0 met15A0 ura3A0). The mating-type-specific promoters were also tested in BY4742 (MATa his3A1 leu2A0 lys2A0 ura3A0) and BY4743 (diploid cross of BY4741 and 4742). The galactose-induction experiments were conducted in a GALZ knockout of BY4741. The multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments were conducted in an S288C MATa haploid with a complete URA3 coding sequence deletion.\nConstitutive promoter and terminator characterization experiments were conducted in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Dextrose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Complete w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological), 0.85% (w/v) MOPS Free Acid (Sigma), 0.1 M Dipotassium phosphate (Sigma), 100 µg/L Zeocin (Life Technologies), buffered to pH 7.\nGalactose inductions were performed in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Raffinose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Synthetic Minus Uracil w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological), plus 0–5% (w/v) Galactose (Fisher Scientific).\nCopper inductions were performed in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Dextrose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Complete w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological), plus 0–50 µM Copper(II) Sulfate added.\nAll other experiments were conducted in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Dextrose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Synthetic Minus appropriate amino acids w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological).\nYPD was used for preparing cells for transformation and recovery after heat shock: 1% (w/v) Bacto Yeast Extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto Peptone, 2% (w/v) Dextrose.\nTG1 chemically competent E. coli was used for all cloning experiments. Transformed cells were selected on Lysogeny Broth (LB) with the appropriate antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or kanamycin).\nYeast Transformations. Yeast colonies were grown to saturation overnight in YPD, then diluted 1:100 in 50 mL of fresh media and grown for 4–6 h to OD600–0.8. Cells were pelleted and washed once with water and twice with 100 mM Lithium Acetate (Sigma). Cells were then mixed by vortexing with 2.4 mL of 50% PEG-3350 (Fisher Scientific), 360 µL of 1 M Lithium Acetate, 250 µL of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 500 µL of water. DNA was added to 100–350 µL of transformation mixture and incubated at 42 °C for 25 min. When selecting for prototrophy, the transformation mixture was pelleted, resuspended in water, and plated directly onto solid agar plates. When selecting for drug resistance, the transformation mixture was pelleted, resuspended in YPD, incubated at 30 °C for 2 h with shaking, pelleted and washed with water, then plated onto solid agar plates.\nPlasmids designed for chromosomal integration (i.e., containing 5’ and 3’ genome homology regions without a yeast origin of replication) were digested with NotI for 10 min prior to transformation to stimulate homologous recombination. The entire digestion reaction (without DNA cleanup) was included in the transformation in place of plasmid DNA.\nGolden Gate Assembly Protocol. A Golden Gate reaction mixture was prepared as follows: 0.5 µL of each DNA insert or plasmid, 1 µL T4 DNA Ligase buffer (NEB), 0.5 µL T7 DNA Ligase (NEB), 0.5 µL restriction enzyme, and water to bring the final volume to 10 µL. The restriction enzymes used were either Baal or BsmBI (both 10 000 U/mL from NEB). The amount of DNA inserts can optionally be normalized to equimolar concentrations (~20 fmol each) to improve assembly efficiencies.\nReaction mixtures were incubated in a thermocycler according to the following program: 25 cycles of digestion and ligation (42 °C for 2 min, 16 °C for 5 min) followed by a final digestion step (60 °C for 10 min), and a heat inactivation step (80 °C for 10 min). In some cases, where noted in the text, the final digestion and heat inactivation steps were omitted.\nCloning of Parts. See Supporting Information for details on construction of new parts.\nPromoter, Terminator, and Degradation Tag Characterization. Promoter, terminator, and degradation tag testing constructs were integrated into the URA3 locus of the yeast chromosome. Constitutive promoter, terminator, and degradation tag testing constructs were selected using a Zeocin resistance cassette; mating-type and indouble promoter testing constructs were selected for uracil prototrophy.\nColonies were picked and grown in 500 µL of media in 96-deep-well blocks at 30 °C in an ATR shaker, shaking at 750 rpm until saturated. Cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh media, grown for 12–16 h, then diluted 1:3 in fresh media, and fluorescence was measured on a TECAN Safire2. For the galactose inductions, the media was switched during the dilution step from 2% dextrose to 2% raffinose with different concentrations of galactose. For the copper inductions, saturated cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh media with different concentrations of copper(II) sulfate and grown for 18 h.\nExcitation and emission wavelengths used to measure fluorescent proteins were mTurquoise2 at 435 nm/478 nm, Venus at 516 nm/530 nm, and mRuby2 at 559 nm/600 nm. Raw fluorescence values were first normalized to the OD600 of the cultures, and then normalized to the background fluorescence of cells not expressing any fluorescent protein. The median log value of biological replicates was calculated and plotted with the range.\nCopy Number Characterization. mRuby2 expression cassettes were assembled onto URA3 plasmids or integrated into the URA3 locus; Venus expression cassettes were assembled onto LEU2 plasmids or integrated into the LEU2 locus. For constructs where the two fluorescent proteins were expressed in tandem from the same locus/plasmid, they were assembled onto URA3 plasmids or integrated into the URA3\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology\n\nlocus; the strain used for these constructs was prototrophic for leucine.\n\nFour colonies of each strain were picked into 400 \\(\\mu\\)L of synthetic media lacking uracil and leucine, and grown in 96-deep-well blocks at 30 °C in an ATR shaker, shaking at 750 rpm until saturated. The saturated cultures were measured for bulk fluorescence in a TECAN Safire2. The cultures were then diluted 1:100 into fresh media, grown for 4 h, and measured on a Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer.\n\nExcitation and emission wavelengths used to measure bulk fluorescence on the TECAN were Venus at 516 nm/530 nm and mRuby2 at 560 nm/590 nm. Fluorescence values were normalized and reported in the same manner as the promoter characterization experiments.\n\nThe lasers and filters used on the flow cytometer were a 488 nm laser and a FITC filter (505LP 530/30) for Venus; a 561 nm laser and PE-Texas Red filter (595LP 610/20) for mRuby2. Voltages for each channel were kept constant for all samples at all copy numbers. Fluorescence was normalized for cell size by dividing by forward-scatter. Cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo (http://www.flowjo.com).\n\nNote: the selectable auxotrophic markers for uracil and leucine used in these experiments were different from those included in the toolkit. At the time these experiments were conducted, we had designed markers that encoded for the native Ura3p and Leu2p proteins, but used alternate codons for almost every position. We also used the respective terminator sequence from Ashbya gossypii, although we used the native S. cerevisiae promoter. The reason for these changes was an attempt to construct selectable markers with orthogonal sequences that would minimize undesired recombination with the chromosome, particularly for strains that did not have clean deletions of those genes as BY4741 does. Unfortunately, some of the changes resulted in a reduced growth rate on selective media, and were abandoned in favor of the native sequences. The only other experiment to use the alternative markers was the high-efficiency integration experiment (which also used HIS3).\n\nHigh-Efficiency Integrations. The experimental strain used for the integration efficiency experiments was prepared by integrating the landing pad into BY4741 as depicted in Supporting Figure S4A. The repair DNA was constructed in two ways, with and without a CEN6/ARS4 origin. The plasmid with an origin was transformed and used to normalize the colony counts of all other transformations. The plasmid without an origin was linearized using NotI prior to transformation. The cutting plasmids expressing either I-Scel or Cas9/sgRNA were constructed onto CEN6/ARS4 plasmids with a HIS3 selection marker, but were never selected for and were presumably present only transiently in cells. The cutting plasmids either were or were not also linearized with NotI prior to transformation. 100 fmol of each DNA (cutter and/or repair) was added to 350 \\(\\mu\\)L of transformation mix. After heat shock, 1/10th of the transformation was plated onto synthetic media lacking histidine. Pictures of the plates were taken and colonies were counted using Benchling (https://benchling.com).\n\nMultiplexed Knockouts. 1 \\(\\mu g\\) of the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid (\\(\\sim\\)100 ng/\\(\\mu\\)L) and 5 \\(\\mu g\\) of linear repair DNA (\\(\\sim\\)500 ng/\\(\\mu\\)L) were added to 300 \\(\\mu\\)L of transformation mix. For the no repair controls, 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of water was added in place of the DNA. After heat shock, cells were washed with 300 \\(\\mu\\)L of water, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of water and plated entirely onto synthetic media lacking uracil.\n\nTo screen for the knockout phenotype(s), 40 colonies were picked into 500 \\(\\mu\\)L of synthetic media lacking uracil in 96-deep-well blocks and grown at 30 °C in an ATR shaker, shaking at 750 rpm. Saturated cultures were washed twice in 500 \\(\\mu\\)L of water, then diluted 1:100 into four different media, each lacking the appropriate amino acid (leucine, histidine, methionine (and cysteine), or tryptophan). These cultures were then incubated again at 30 °C at 750 rpm, and we counted the number of clones that showed growth in the correct set of media.\n\nProtopacer sequences for sgRNAs were designed using Benchling (see Supporting Table S2 for a list). See Supporting Figure S5A for details on the design of repair DNA.\n\n■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n● Supporting Information\nAll 96 plasmids described in this toolkit are available from Addgene (http://www.addgene.org).

These variants exhibit distinctive fast, medium and slow blue-to-red chromophore maturation rates that depend on the temperature. At 37 °C, the maxima of the blue fluorescence are observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence are reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively. The FTs show similar timing behavior in bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Medium-FT allowed for tracking of the intracellular dynamics of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) and determination of its age in the targeted compartments. The results indicate that LAMP-2A transport through the plasma membrane and early or recycling endosomes to lysosomes is a major pathway for LAMP-2A trafficking.  \n\nMonomeric fluorescent proteins of various emission wavelengths have become invaluable tools for studying the spatial behavior of intracellular molecules, including their localization and interaction\\(^1\\). To visualize temporal and spatial molecular events, FTs\\(^2\\), which change their emission wavelengths over time, could be especially valuable. The only currently available FT is DsRed-Timer FT (also known as DsRed-E5)\\(^3\\); however, it is a tetramer, which prevents its application as a protein fusion tag. Nevertheless, the tetrameric state of the DsRed-Timer does not limit its use to study gene activities\\(^4\\), relative age of organelles\\(^5\\) and cell differentiation\\(^3\\).  \n\nIt has been suggested that a red DsRed-like chromophore in the red fluorescent proteins (RfPs) results from an oxidation of a protonated blue form of the GFP-like chromophore, not from the green anionic form, which is a dead-end product\\(^6\\). This suggested scheme for red chromophore maturation provides a basis for developing monomeric FTs that change their color from blue to red. The most suitable templates for this appear to be the monomeric variants of DsRed\\(^7\\). One of these variants, mCherry, was chosen for a directed molecular evolution to develop three monomeric FTs with different maturation rates between the protonated blue GFP-like and the anionic red DsRed-like chromophore states.  \n\nFTs can be used as molecular genetically encoded tools to study trafficking of different cellular proteins and to provide accurate insight into the timing of intracellular processes.

An example of a longstanding dilemma is the contribution of different pathways to trafficking and final delivery of\nLAMP-2A to lysosomes. LAMP-2A is encoded by a spliced variant of the lamp2 gene and\nacts as a lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)[8,9]. LAMP-2A is sorted\nto endosomes and lysosomes through a tyrosine-based signal in its cytosolic C terminus, but\na fraction of the protein is also observed at the plasma membrane[10]. This dual location led\ninvestigators to propose the existence of both direct (Golgi to lysosomes) and indirect (through\nendocytosis from the plasma membrane) targeting of LAMP-2A to lysosomes[11]. The use of\nFTs has allowed us to study the sequence of events involved in transport of LAMP-2A to\nlysosomes and to determine the preferential pathway followed by LAMP-2A for its trafficking.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n**Development of monomeric FTs**\n\nThe gene encoding mCherry was used as a template for the multiple saturated mutagenesis at\npositions 42, 44, 65, 69, 106, 148, 203 and 224 (amino acid numbering follows that of Aequorea\n_victoria GFP; see Fig. 1a). These positions were identified either according to the X-ray_\nstructure of mCherry[12] or using experimental data regarding amino acid substitutions affecting\nmaturation of DsRed variants[13–15]. It has been shown that substitutions at these positions slow\nor accelerate formation of the red chromophore. According to the mCherry structure, residues\n42 and 44 are close to the Met65 residue of the mCherry chromophore, and residues 69, 148\nand 203 are close to the phenolic and/or imidazolinone rings of the chromophore. Residue 224\nwas found in close proximity to residue 203 and has been suggested to indirectly influence\nchromophore positioning. Therefore, a bacterial library of mutants at positions 42, 44, 65, 69,\n106, 148, 203 and 224 was screened for clones with fast, medium and slow maturation rates\nusing a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) followed by analysis of the collected colonies\non petri dishes using a fluorescence stereomicroscope.\n\nAs a result of screening the library of mutants with the site-specific substitutions at the eight\npositions indicated above, mCherry K69R and mCherry K69R A224S mutants with FT\nphenotypes were found (Supplementary Table 1 online). These mutants exhibited blue forms\nthat were not detected in the original mCherry. However, the brightness of the blue fluorescence\nwas very low in the case of mCherry K69R. The maturation rates of the red forms were slowed\nas compared to that of mCherry. Other mutations found in the analyzed variants did not lead\nto the FT phenotypes. Because the mCherry K69R A224S mutant exhibited the blue form\nearlier than the mCherry K69R variant, the former was further used for random mutagenesis\nto screen for the fast-FT phenotype. Consequently, the mCherry K69R mutant was used as a\ntemplate for random mutagenesis aimed to screen for medium-FT and slow-FT phenotypes.\nSequential rounds of the random mutagenesis followed by screening of mutant clones using\nFACS and fluorescence stereomicroscopy were applied. The bacterial libraries of random\nmutants typically consisted of 10[6] to 10[7] clones.\n\nThe number of rounds for random mutagenesis varied depending on the specific FT phenotype\nand consisted of four, five and three rounds for the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT,\nrespectively. Over several rounds of random mutagenesis, the fluorescence intensities of both\nblue and red forms of the best FT variants increased and reached plateaus (Supplementary Fig.\n1 online). When we were not able to find a better variant in the next round of mutagenesis, we\nstopped improvement of that FT using random mutagenesis.\n\nA key mutation found in the first round of mutagenesis for all FT phenotypes was L84W.\nVariants containing this amino acid substitution exhibited substantially brighter blue and red\nfluorescence intensities. Mutations at position 18 such as M18V and M18L resulted in a slight\n\n_Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1._\n\n===== Page 3 =====\n\ndecrease of the red intensity that, however, was compensated by a large increase of the blue fluorescence. Therefore we decided to choose variants with these mutations for the next random mutagenesis.\n\nDuring the subsequent rounds of mutagenesis, several additional internal positions such as 112, 143, 152, 179 and 205, which contained important substitutions, were found. For example, in the fast-FT phenotype, the mutation S112T increased the brightness of both red and blue forms to about the same extent. In the medium-FT phenotype, mutations M143K and L205M increased the brightness of the blue form and increased the efficiency of the blue-to-red chromophore maturation. The introduction of M152L and M152I amino acid substitutions in medium-FT variants substantially increased the brightness of the red but not the blue form. Several mutations such as F63C, S112C and A179V reduced chromophore maturation rates; however, only the latter mutation did not decrease the brightness of the blue form, and therefore we chose this mutation for the slow-FT phenotype.\n\nTo make sure that during the multistage screening and selection procedures we did not miss mutants with some advantageous substitutions at the identified key positions, we applied the best fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT variants found in the random mutagenesis for an additional saturated site-specific mutagenesis at positions 69, 84, 143, 179, 203 and 205. However, no better FT versions were found. The final residues neighboring the chromophore in each construct are shown in Figure 1b-d, and all important mutations found during the molecular evolution of mCherry into the FTs are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nProperties of FTs in vitro\n\nThe fluorescence properties of the new constructs were investigated (Fig. 2). The blue forms of the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT had excitation/emission peaks of 403/466, 401/464 and 402/465 nm, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2a for fast-FT; other FTs exhibited similar spectra). The respective red forms had excitation/emission peaks of 583/606, 579/600 and 583/604 nm. The absorbance of both forms had the same maxima as the fluorescence excitation spectra. The external mutations in the FTs were located outside of the dimerizing interfaces observed in the DsRed structure\\(^16\\). Subsequently, like the parental mCherry, all FTs exhibited the monomeric behavior (Supplementary Fig. 2 online).\n\nMolar extinction coefficients and quantum yields of the blue forms of the FTs were in the range of 33,400-49,700 M\\(^{-1}\\)cm\\(^{-1}\\) and 0.30-0.41, respectively (Table 1). The fluorescence of the blue forms exhibited high pH stability, with pKa values below 3.0 (Fig. 2g). For comparison, the best blue fluorescent protein reported so far, EBFP2, has lower pH stability, with a pKa value of about 4.5. Extinction coefficients of the FT red forms were higher than those of the blue forms and varied between 73,100 and 84,200 M\\(^{-1}\\)cm\\(^{-1}\\). The quantum yields for the FT red forms varied in the range of 0.05-0.09. The fluorescences of the red forms had pH stabilities similar to those of the parental mCherry, with pKa values of 4.1-4.7 (Fig. 2h). Because the fluorescence of both blue and red forms decreased with acidification, the ratio between these fluorescence intensities changed with pH notably less than the red signal but more than the blue signal (Fig. 2i). For all FTs, the ratio changed less than 8% within the pH range of 5.4-7.4.\n\nDuring the FT maturation, the fluorescence of the blue forms increased to its maximum value, and after that decreased to zero (Fig. 2a-c). The fluorescence of the red forms increased with time with some delay and then reached a plateau. At 37 °C the maxima of the blue fluorescence intensities were observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence intensities were reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively, which corresponds to the half-times of the maturation for the red FT forms. These characteristic times increased at lower temperatures such as 16 °C and 25 °C and decreased at higher temperatures such as 45 °C (Table 1). The ratios between the red and blue\n\n===== Page 4 =====\n\nfluorescence intensities exhibited parabolic growth dependencies with time for each FT. The higher the temperature, the faster the growth of the red-to-blue ratio; this observation provided a single meaning for the age of the particular FT (Fig. 2d-f). These ratio curves can be easily adapted for other instruments using the ratio of the reference dyes. Furthermore, these data suggest that calibration curves based on the FT red-to-blue ratio can be used to determine the time from the start of FT production under any specific conditions.\n\nTo quantitatively describe the chromophore conversion pathway in the FTs, we applied kinetic model (1). This model was based on the proposed earlier mechanism for chromophore formation in tetrameric DsRed protein [6]. A spectrally undetectable C-form, which represents a cyclized chromophore-forming tripeptide in the reduced (and therefore colorless) state, is converted into a blue form (B-form), which then turns into a red form (R-form) (Scheme 1). It has been shown that in fluorescent proteins, polypeptide folding and cyclization of the chromophore-forming tripeptide occur substantially faster than the oxidation steps [17]. The formation of the B-form precedes the red chromophore formation in many red FPs including DsRed and HeRed1. It has been suggested that the B-form is a common intermediate for the red chromophores [6]. For the FTs, model (1) consisted of the following kinetic steps:\n\n\\[\\text{C}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{B}}}\\text{B}\\xrightarrow{k_{1}}\\text{I}\\xrightarrow {k_{\\text{R}}}\\text{R}\\] (1)\n\nwhere C and I are the nonfluorescent chromophore forms, B and R are the blue and red forms of FTs, and \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\), \\(k_{\\text{I}}\\) and \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) are the kinetic rate constants [6] (Scheme 1). It has been suggested that the B-form is a protonated (neutral) form of the GFP-like chromophore p-(hydroxybenzylidene)-imidazolin-5-one [18]. This form results from an oxidation of the Tyr66 αC-βC bond of the C-form with the formation of a double bond. The mature deprotonated (anionic) R-form contains an additional double bond between the α carbon and amide nitrogen of Met65. The I-forms may present an unstable short-lived carbanion intermediate, which is formed from the B-form by a proton abstraction from the α carbon of Met65. The formation of the carbanion intermediate is possible because of stabilization, by a side chain of Arg69 (which is introduced to all FTs by site-specific mutagenesis), of the negative charge delocalized within the aromatic system.\n\nTwo steps in the mechanism of red chromophore formation (C\\(\\rightarrow\\)B and I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R) are irreversible because both of them are accompanied by chromophore oxidation with the formation of the double bonds [6, 12, 16]. The step B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I is the deprotonation of the neutral blue form with formation of at least one intermediate compound, such as the carbanion. Because the exact number and chemical nature of the intermediate compounds is unknown and particularly because the next I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R oxidation step is irreversible, we have approximated the B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I process by irreversible reaction.\n\nWe used model (1) above to fit the experimental FT maturation curves obtained _in vitro_ for all three purified proteins at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C (presented in Fig. 2c for the fast-FT at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C). We further determined rate constants for each chromophore maturation step in the FTs at different temperatures (Scheme 1 and Supplementary Table 2 online). The \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\) constants were substantially larger than \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) for the fast-FT and slow-FT, which indicates that the I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R steps were the limiting reactions for red chromophore formation in these FTs. In the case of medium-FT, the limiting step for red form formation was B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I. This suggests that the long-lived intermediate I-form or blue B-form might be responsible for the delays in the formation of the FT red forms--that is, for the timing behavior.\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 5\n\nBehavior of FTs in different cell types\n\nTo study the behavior of the FTs in a system other than bacteria, we expressed them in stable clones of Drosophila melanogaster Schrieder’s 2 (S2) cells under the control of the inducible metallothionein promoter\\(^{19}\\). After the induction with copper sulfate of the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT for 0.5, 1 and 2 h, respectively, expression was stopped. The blue and red fluorescence of the S2 cells was then analyzed using flow cytometry at different times during 15 days of cell growth at 25 °C (Fig. 3).\n\nTo study timing in mammalian cells, the FTs were expressed in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells at 37 °C using the Tet-Off system\\(^{20}\\). Several hours after the transfection, transcription was stopped by addition of a doxycycline, and later the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at different times (see Fig. 4a for slow-FT; other FTs resulted in similar histograms).\n\nAs with the purified FTs and the proteins expressed in bacteria, the blue fluorescence of the insect cells at 25 °C and mammalian cells at 37 °C expressing the FTs increased, reached its maxima, and then decreased to almost zero. The red fluorescence also increased with time; however, in contrast to the in vitro data, it then slowly decreased (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4b). Furthermore, for all FTs the growth of the blue and red forms and the decrease of the blue forms were slower than those for the purified FTs. These data indicate that (i) the translation of FTs occurs for some time after termination of transcription with doxycycline or removal of copper sulfate and (ii) like other proteins, the FTs are susceptible to proteasomal degradation.\n\nTo quantitatively describe the kinetics of the blue and red FT forms in live S2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 3 online), we modified the above model (1) with two minimal additional kinetic steps and got the following kinetic model (2):\n\n\\[N \\xrightarrow{k_C} C \\xrightarrow{k_B} B \\xrightarrow{k_1} I \\xrightarrow{k_R} R \\xrightarrow{k_D} D\\]\n\nwhere N is ribonucleic acid, D is the degraded nonfluorescent FTs and \\( k_C \\) and \\( k_D \\) are the kinetic rate constants. The first step (from ribonucleic acid to cyclized chromophore-forming tripeptide form) reflects prolongation of protein translation from the ribonucleic acid N after termination of its transcription. The second step (from the red FT to the degraded nonfluorescent FT) reflects degradation of FTs in live cells to the nondetectable D form.\n\nThe resulting values of \\( k_C \\) for S2 cells were rather close for all FTs (0.009-0.013 h\\(^{-1}\\): Supplementary Table 2). This was also true for the \\( k_C \\) rate constants in HeLa cells (0.29 h\\(^{-1}\\) for medium-FT and 0.30 h\\(^{-1}\\) for slow-FT), which indicates similar lifetimes for the FT mRNAs in the same type of cells. The \\( k_C \\) values for the HeLa cells suggest that the mRNA amount should be 10% after 8 h and 3% after 12 h incubation with doxycycline. A similar time course for the activity of the luciferase has been observed after inhibition of its transcription with tetracycline\\(^{20}\\). Within 8 h, luciferase activity dropped to about 10% and was less than 2% of its original value after 12 h\\(^{20}\\). The \\( k_D \\) values observed for the FTs at 37 °C were in good agreement with previous reports on the 24 h half-life time for GFP in mammalian cell cytoplasm after the inhibition of its transcription and translation\\(^{21}\\).\n\nIntracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A\n\nTo explore the advantage of the FTs in vivo, we used FTs to study the intracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A. Previous studies on LAMPs trafficking using biochemical and immunofluorescence approaches had suggestedthat LAMPs canreach thelysosomevia twointracellular routes: a direct pathway from the Golgi to the late endosomes and lysosomes\\(^{22,23}\\), and an indirect pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane following\n\n*Nat Chem Biol.* Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1.\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nthe secretory pathway, and then to lysosomes via endocytosis[24-26]. Although it was initially\nconsidered that the pool of LAMPs at the plasma membrane was only evident under certain\nconditions (such as platelet activation or certain tumors), later studies knocking down adaptor\ntrafficking proteins demonstrated that a portion of cellular LAMPs can be detected at the plasma\nmembrane even under normal physiological conditions (reviewed in ref. [10]). In fact, analysis\nof chimera proteins of the luminal region of LAMP-1 and the three different cytosolic tails of\nLAMP-2 revealed that the variants reaching the plasma membrane were mainly LAMP-2A\nand LAMP-2B (ref. 27). However, in most of the previous studies, the plasma membrane\nlocation of the LAMPs was analyzed at a steady state. Although the combined use of surface\nbiotinylation and cellular permeabilization helped to demonstrate that some membrane LAMPs\nare internalized, it was not possible to determine which fraction of the total LAMPs transits\nthrough the plasma membrane in a dynamic manner. Lastly, in all the previous studies relying\non biochemical analysis, individual differences from cell to cell on the dynamics of\ninternalization of LAMPs from the plasma membrane could not be determined. We predicted\nthat using LAMP-2A-FT fusion proteins, we could possibly estimate the age of the LAMP-2A\nmolecules in different cellular compartments during their trafficking and determine the main\nLAMP-2A targeting mechanism.\n\nTo choose an FT with the appropriate timing behavior, we first tested the localization of\nLAMP-2A fusion constructs with all FTs expressed under the constitutive cytomegalovirus\npromoter. Several types of mammalian cells exhibiting different levels of CMA activity were\ntransiently transfected with this construct (see Supplementary Fig. 4 online for Cos-1 cells).\nWe observed that in the case of LAMP-2A-fast-FT, the blue form mainly localized in an area\ncompatible with the Golgi, and the red form was visualized as vesicular structures (endosomes\nor lysosomes). The blue form of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT localized in the Golgi, plasma\nmembrane and vesicular structures, and the red form was predominantly detected in the\nvesicular formations. In the case of the LAMP-2A-slow-FT, the blue form was observed in the\nvesicular structures, with only a small amount at the cell membrane. All of the red form of the\nLAMP-2A-slow-FT was observed in the vesicles. Because the LAMP-2A-medium-FT fusion\ncan be detected in several cellular compartments at the same time, this construct was further\napplied to study trafficking using the Tet-Off system.\n\nWe found that at 1 and 6 h after the pulse-chase expression, an early blue form of the LAMP-2Amedium-FT was the major fluorescent form observed in live HeLa Tet-Off cells (Fig. 4c). The\namount of the blue form then gradually decreased until its complete disappearance at 63 h,\nwhereas the late red form of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT increased, reaching its maximum\nbetween 36.5 and 63 h (Fig. 4c). The newly synthesized fusion protein was slowly trafficked\nthrough the Golgi, where it could be detected for up to 12 h. Between 6 and 21 h, a percentage\nof the blue form was also observed at the plasma membrane, which, however, was never\nhighlighted with the late red protein. These data indicate that LAMP-2A at the plasma\nmembrane did not result from the fusion of pre-existing lysosomal compartments, but was\nprimarily targeted there from the Golgi after synthesis.\n\nTo identify the nature of the vesicular compartments in which LAMP-2A-medium-FT was\ndetected, we applied transferrin-Alexa 488 to visualize early and recycling endosomes, and\nLysotracker Green to stain late endosomes and lysosomes (Supplementary Fig. 5 online). At\n6 h after the expression, we observed almost complete co-localization of the late red form of\nthe fusion protein with transferrin-Alexa 488. At 12 and 21 h the co-localization became partial,\nand only a very small fraction of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT merged with transferrin-Alexa\n488 at later times. In contrast, co-localization of the red form with Lysotracker Green was\npartial at 6 and 12 h, but became almost complete at all times after 21 h.\n\n_Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1._\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 7\n\nBecause the intense blue fluorescence at the perinuclear region could be masking individual lysosomal structures and thus might complicate discrimination between the different compartments in that region, we also imaged the blue form of LAMP-2A-medium-FT in combination with Lysotracker Green to discriminate between compartments based on a red-to-blue ratio. The regions where blue or red fluorescence was merged with Lysotracker Green were referred to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Bright blue fluorescence was not observed in the regions merged with Lysotracker Green at early times after LAMP-2A-medium-FT expression (Supplementary Fig. 6 online). The red signal of LAMP-2A-medium-FT in the regions co-stained with Lysotracker Green was substantially larger than that in the perinuclear region. Even when lysosomes identified with Lysotracker staining were occasionally found in the perinuclear region, their red fluorescence was substantially brighter than the red fluorescence in other parts of the perinuclear region that were not stained with Lysotracker.\n\nTo determine the nature of the intense blue signal in the perinuclear region observed at earlier times of pulse-chase expression of LAMP-2A-medium-FT, we used β-1,4-galactosyltransferase-EYFP (GalT-EYFP) as a Golgi marker[28, 29, 30]. GalT is anchored in the membranes of the trans-Golgi network[30, 31, 32]. The Golgi marker merged with the intense blue signal localized in the perinuclear region at 1 and 6 h after expression (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). At later times, the blue signal only coincided partially with GalT-EYFP, whereas co-localization of the red signal with the Golgi marker was not observed at any time after the LAMP-2A expression. These results support the observation that the bright blue fluorescence observed at the perinuclear region corresponds to molecules of LAMP-2A still in the Golgi.\n\nWe took advantage of the FT monomeric states to estimate the mean age for the LAMP-2A-medium-FT molecules in different organelles. It is unlikely that a fusion partner such as LAMP-2A affects maturation of the FT chromophore, which is tightly shielded inside of the β-can. Therefore, the same maturation times of blue and red forms of the free FT and FT fusion construct should correspond to the same time after FT expression in both cases. To preserve functionality of the chimera we fused the FTs to the N terminus of LAMP-2A, which is located in the lysosomal lumen. We determined that the red-to-blue ratio for medium-FT had small changes in the pH range of 5.4-7.4 (Fig. 2i). This is an important issue because pH values close to 5.4 have been detected in late endosomes and lysosomes, whereas pH values not exceeding 7.4 have been observed in Golgi, early and recycling endosomes, and cytoplasm. These observations allowed us to apply the kinetic model that successfully described spectral changes of the cytoplasmically expressed FTs in live cells. In other words, by comparing the red-to-blue ratios for free medium-FT detected with flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 3) to those for LAMP-2A-medium-FT obtained using cell imaging (Fig. 4c), we have estimated the mean ages of the fusion construct in each of the targeted compartments at various times after its expression has stopped (Table 2). The evaluated mean ages in different compartments indicate the indirect intracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A from the Golgi through the plasma membrane and early or recycling endosomes to the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. 12 h after expression, most of the protein resides in the late endosomes and lysosomes.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe primary aim of this investigation was development of new tools to study the spatial and temporal distribution of individual proteins in live cells. As a result of the mutagenesis screening, we have found three monomeric FTs with distinctive blue-to-red conversion timing, which we named fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT. The fast-FT has five amino acid mutations as compared to the original mCherry. Among them K69R, L84W and A224S are internal to the β-can mCherry fold and E34K and S151T are external to the fold. The medium-FT exhibits nine amino acid substitutions, of which K69R, L84W, M152I and L205M are internal, and N23D, T43S, Q194L, Y221C and R227H are external. The slow-FT has only four mutations,\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\nof which K69R, L84W and A179V are internal and E30V is external. The immediate environment of the chromophores of the FTs is shown in Figure 1b-d.\n\nAll FTs contain K69R and L84W substitutions. According to the mCherry structure[12], a residue at position 84 influences positioning of residue 69. For example, K84L substitution in mCherry relative to the original DsRed resulted in a 2.7-Å shift of Lys69. Similarly, L84W mutation can lead to a change of position of Arg69 in FTs. On the other hand, the amino acid at position 69 alone plays an important role in formation of the red chromophore. Lysine or arginine amino acids are almost always found at this position in RFPs[14]. In DsRed, K69R is the only substitution that preserved formation of the red chromophore, while slowing its maturation, whereas other substitutions at this position resulted in green chromophores[33]. Therefore Arg69 and Trp84 appear to be the key amino acids responsible for the timing behavior of the mCherry-based blue-to-red FTs.\n\nOther substitutions observed in the FTs are possibly involved in time-tuning of each particular FT. In the mCherry structure, Ala224 forms van der Waals contact with Ile203, which is in close proximity to the chromophore[12]. The A224S substitution in the fast-FT introduces an additional hydroxyl group affecting positioning of Ile203.\n\nLeu205 in mCherry forms several van der Waals contacts with the tyrosine in the chromophore. In addition, Met152 forms van der Waals contacts with Glu150 and Tyr185, which are in close proximity to the chromophore. Therefore, M152I and L205M mutations in the medium-FT can influence red chromophore maturation.\n\nThe Ala179 residue in the mCherry structure forms van der Waals contacts with the internal amino acids Met98 and Phe100. However, in the DsRed structure[16], Met98 and Phe100 have van der Waals contacts with Val105. As compared to DsRed, DsRed-E5 FT has only two substitutions, V105A and S203T (ref. 3). Therefore we speculate that the A179V mutation observed in the slow-FT may affect the maturation rate of the red chromophore, much like V105A substitution in DsRed-E5.\n\nIn this work we demonstrate the advantages of FTs for visualizing temporal and spatial molecular events using as example the intracellular trafficking of a lysosomal membrane protein. Based on the red-to-blue ratios observed for LAMP-2A-medium-FT in different compartments at various imaging time points, one may suggest the following major intracellular traffic pattern for the protein: Golgi → plasma membrane → early and recycling endosomes → late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data support the predominant indirect targeting of LAMP-2A to lysosomes[11]. The relatively low LAMP-2A levels observed at the plasma membrane suggest a rather short retention time for the protein in this compartment. In fact, at various imaging time points the mean ages of the LAMP-2A-medium-FTs in early and recycling endosomes differ substantially from those in the Golgi (Table 2). On the other hand, the difference between the ages of LAMP-2A proteins in the Golgi and those at the plasma membrane is small, which suggests that LAMP-2A is present there for a rather limited time. Therefore, any additional protein flow from the Golgi directly to early and recycling endosomes and then to lysosomes seems to be unlikely.\n\nThe use of FTs to study this process has also allowed us to identify a small fraction of LAMP-2A that recycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane. This conclusion is based on the following: if LAMP-2A travels from the Golgi to early endosomes and then recycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane, we should see two populations of endosomes with the different ages of LAMP-2A-FT. The first population would have a red-to-blue ratio smaller than or equal to that on the plasma membrane, while the second population could have a red-to-blue ratio larger than that on the membrane. The microscopy data clearly indicate that for the majority of early and recycling endosomes, the red-to-blue ratio is larger than that on the\n\n===== Page 9 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 9\n\nplasma membrane. However, there is a small fraction (less than 20%) of early and recycling endosomes that have red-to-blue ratios comparable to those on the membrane, but never smaller. Consequently, a quite small fraction of LAMP-2A is involved in the recycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes.\n\nOur results provide, to our knowledge for the first time, an in vivo analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a lysosomal membrane protein. Specifically, the FTs allowed us (i) to follow the trafficking of LAMP-2A, (ii) to confirm the universality of the indirect pathway without having to introduce genetic modifications in the adaptor proteins (thus allowing us to avoid possible compensatory mechanisms), (iii) to establish that engagement of LAMP-2A through the indirect pathway is not a default mechanism, but instead, as proposed through the genetic analysis, affects a large percentage of the intracellular protein and (iv) to estimate the time of trafficking to the plasma membrane and from the membrane to lysosomes in live intact cells, without subjecting the cell membrane to modifications with biotinylation or permeabilization.\n\nThe analysis of LAMP-2A behavior demonstrates the advantages of using monomeric FTs to elucidate the dynamics of intracellular proteins under various physiological and pathological conditions. The monomeric FT proteins will also allow for identification of recycling events among compartments, temporal tracking of molecules before and after a particular cellular event (without the need for additional labeling or artificial photoswitching) and timing of particular intracellular post-translational modifications traceable by fluorescent procedures such as ubiquitination and farnesylation. Selection of the appropriate FT is an important step to reveal timing of the specific cellular process to be studied. Therefore, availability of three FTs with distinctive chromophore maturation times will be useful for studies of cellular processes with substantially different time scales. Furthermore, the blue and red fluorescent colors provide the possibility to use FTs together with GFPs for protein multicolor labeling in the cell. The FT monomeric states will be useful for FRET applications with GFP-labeled FRET partners. In contrast to tetrameric DsRed-E5, the monomeric FTs will allow a sequential bimolecular fluorescence complementation of FT molecules followed by FT maturation to determine the intracellular timing of protein-protein interactions\\(^2\\).\n\nMETHODS\nMutagenesis\n\nThe gene encoding mCherry was PCR amplified as a BgIII-EcoRI fragment and inserted into a pBAD/His-B vector (Invitrogen). Site-specific mutagenesis of the gene encoding mCherry was performed using QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For simultaneous mutagenesis at several positions, an overlap-extension approach was applied\\(^3\\)4. Random mutagenesis was performed with GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using conditions resulting in a mutation frequency of up to 16 mutations per 1,000 base pairs. After mutagenesis, a mixture of the mutants was electroporated into LMG194 bacteria (Invitrogen).\n\nLibrary screening\n\nTo find FTs with distinctive timing behavior, libraries of mutants cloned under the arabinose promoter were screened for bright blue and non-red clones at different times after the induction of protein expression—usually 1, 4 or 24 h for the relatively fast, medium and slow chromophore formation rates, respectively. Then, protein production was suppressed with glucose, and the selected clones were re-screened for the bright red and non-blue phenotype 24 and 48 h later for the fast-medium and the slow maturation rates, respectively. After each round of screening, about 8-10 mutants were considered as promising for the next rounds of mutagenesis; these mutants were characterized by (i) distinctive blue-to-red fluorescence\n\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nNai Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1.\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\nchanges, (ii) the brightest fluorescence of both blue and red forms, (iii) specific timing for blue-to-red changes and (iv) external amino acid substitutions that were not located at the dimerizing interfaces observed in the DsRed structure. Further details are described in the Supplementary Methods online.\n\n### Protein characterization\n\nMaturation of the blue and red forms was studied at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To determine extinction coefficients, we relied on measuring the mature chromophore concentrations [35], taking into account that the extinction coefficient of the model compound of the tyrosine-containing GFP-like chromophores is 44,000 M\\({}^{-1}\\) cm\\({}^{-1}\\) at 447 nm in 1 M NaOH [35] and about 28,500 M\\({}^{-1}\\) cm\\({}^{-1}\\) at 382 nm in 1 M HCl [36]. In the case of blue forms, freshly purified proteins were acid-denatured. In the case of red forms, the proteins matured at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 24-48 h and afterwards were alkali-denatured. To determine quantum yields, the fluorescence intensities of the blue and red forms were compared with equally absorbing EGFP (quantum yield is 0.60; ref. [37]) and mCherry (quantum yield is 0.22; ref. [38]), respectively. pH titrations were performed using a series of buffers (100 mM NaOAc, 300 mM NaCl for pH 2.5-5.0, and 100 mM NaH\\({}_{2}\\)PO\\({}_{4}\\), 300 mM NaCl for pH 4.5-9.0). All fluorescence measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon). The ratio between the emissions of 0.1 \\(\\upmu\\)M rhodamine-101 in 0.01% (w/v) HCl in ethanol at 604 nm (excited at 580 nm) and 10 \\(\\upmu\\)M quinine sulfate in 0.1 M H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) at 465 nm (excited at 402 nm) under the identical instrumental conditions at 25 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C was 33.7.\n\n### Kinetic model for FT maturation\n\nTo quantitatively describe the chromophore conversion pathway in the FTs, we considered two kinetic models, (1) and (3). These models were based on the proposed earlier mechanism for the chromophore formation in tetrameric DsRed protein [6]. Model (3) consisted of the following kinetic steps:\n\n\\[\\text{C}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{B}}}\\text{B}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{R}}} \\text{R}\\] (3)\n\nModel (1) extends (3) by introducing an intermediate I-form between the B-form and R-form (see above) [6]. We used models (1) and (3) to fit the experimental FT maturation curves obtained _in vitro_ for all three purified proteins at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C using the Gepasi chemical kinetics simulation software [39] with the maximal amount of the red forms accepted as 100%. Model (3) described poorly the experimental data on the kinetics of the maturation of the B-form and R-form in all three FTs. The simulated curves for model (3) had coefficients of determination, \\(R^{2}\\), in the range of 0.40-0.62 for the different FTs. The introduction of only a single I-intermediate in model (3) substantially improved the quantitative description of the experimentally observed maturation kinetics for the B-form and R-form. For all three FTs, the simulated curves for model (1) provided \\(R^{2}\\) values above 0.99. Therefore we further applied model (1) to describe the kinetic behavior of both the blue and red forms.\n\nTo quantitatively describe kinetics of the blue and red FT forms in live S2 and HeLa cells, we used kinetic model (2) (see above). The mean brightnesses for the blue and red forms measured by flow cytometry for the FTs cytoplasmically expressed in S2 and HeLa Tet-Off cells were fitted with kinetic model (2) using the Gepasi software [39]. For fitting, the kinetic constants \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\), \\(k_{\\text{I}}\\) and \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) were kept the same as for the purified proteins.\n\n### FACS sorting of _D. melanogaster_ S2 and HeLa Tet-Off cells\n\nFT expression in the stable S2 pre-clonal cell mixture was induced with 1 mM of CuSO\\({}_{4}\\) for 0.5 h for fast-FT, for 1 h for medium-FT and for 2 h for slow-FT. At specific times after either\n\n===== Page 11 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 11\n\nwashing out of CuSO\\(_4\\) (S2) or addition of doxycycline (HeLa), the cells were analyzed with a MoFlo cell sorter using excitation laser lines and emission filters similar to those used for the screening of bacterial libraries.\n\nMicroscopy imaging\nImaging of HeLa, Cos-1, NIH3T3 and HeLa Tet-Off cells was performed 13-122 h after transfection. In the case of HeLa Tet-Off cells, doxycycline was added 12 h after the transfection to stop protein expression. Cells were imaged using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a \\(\\times 100\\) oil immersion objective lens, with custom blue (390/40 nm exciter, 460/40 nm emitter) and red (570/30 nm exciter, 615/40 nm emitter) filter sets (Chroma), that was operated with SlideBook 4.1 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Because FTs have a tendency to photoconvert from the blue to the red form with high-intensity violet light, which may cause light-induced chromophore maturation, cell images were first acquired in the red channel and then in the blue channel. For quantification of red and blue fluorescence intensities in cellular regions of interest, the background autofluorescence measured in the respective regions of nonfluorescent cells on the same coverslip was usually subtracted.\n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank J.

(a) Alignment\nof the amino acid sequences of FTs with GFP and mCherry. Residues buried in β-can are\nshaded. Stars indicate residues that are forming the chromophore. β-sheet-forming regions and\nα-helixes are denoted as arrows and ribbons, respectively. Mutations in FTs relative to mCherry\nare shown in black. Alignment numbering follows that of GFP. (b-d) Immediate environment\nof the chromophore in parental mCherry with mutations found in fast-FT (b), medium-FT (c)\nand slow-FT (d). The surrounding residues are shown within 9.5 Å of the chromophore. The\nchromophore is shown in black, conserved amino acid residues are in light gray, and mutated\nresidues are in gray. Water molecules are represented as gray spheres. Hydrogen bonds are\nindicated with dashed gray lines. Substitution of amino acid residues was performed using\nSwiss PDBViewer v.3.7 (http://www.expasy.org/spdbv/). The best fits for the introduced\nmutated residues were achieved by selection of the rotamers with the lowest scores.\nSubach et al.\nPage 14\nNat Chem Biol.

The “5’ forward” and “3’ reverse” primers bind to the native sequence in the genome, immediately upstream and downstream of the 5’ and 3’ homology sequences, respectively. The “5’ reverse” and “3’ forward” primers bind to the barcodes added within the homology sequence parts and are not present in the genome. Because these barcodes are included within the Type 7 and Type 8b homology parts, the primer pairs are only dependent on which locus is being targeted, not on the genes that are being integrated or the selectable marker being used. A correct integration into a given locus would give ~500bp bands when the 5’ forward + 5’ reverse and 3’ forward + 3’ reverse primer pairs are used, whereas the native strain or an off-target integration would give no bands.\n\n6\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nmRuby2 fluorescence (fold over background)\n\nmTurquoise2 fluorescence (fold over background)\n\nVenus fluorescence (fold over background)\n\nSupplementary Figure S1.

At high copy, high expression of one gene appears to reduce the average expression of the second. Single-cell fluorescence data in Figure 7 shows two subpopulations, one with the expected level of fluorescence and another with reduced fluorescence, which explains the lowered average of bulk measurements.

It should be noted that Types are technically defined only by their flank-\ning overhangs, and the contents need not necessarily match the biologically-defined functions \nwe describe (Supplementary Figure S6). However, in order to ensure compatibility between \nall parts designed by all researchers, we recommend that new parts be designed to match the \nTypes defined here. \n \n \nSupplementary Figure S6\n\n===== Page 13 [text layer] =====\n\n13 \nType 1: 5’ Assembly Connector \n \n \nType 1 parts are flanked by CCCT and AACG (Supplementary Figure S7A). Typically, this \nType contains non-coding, non-regulatory sequences that are used to direct assembly of multi-\ngene plasmids. \nThe Type 1 part plasmids included in the toolkit contain a 143bp concatenation of barcode se-\nquences used in the systematic deletion of yeast genes\n1, a BsmBI recognition site and unique \noverhang, and a 21bp barcode scar (again, from the systematic deletion collection) (Supple-\nmentary Figure S7B). We designate these sequences as Assembly Connectors, and the nomen-\nclature used is “ConLX” where X = 1, 2, 3, etc. The BsmBI site is oriented such that the re-\nstriction enzyme digests the sequence downstream of the recognition sequence. \nThere are also ConLX’ parts, where the structure instead contains first a reversed BsmBI site \n(digests upstream) followed by the 143bp sequence (and no barcode scar) (Supplementary \nFigure S7C). The purpose of this alternate Assembly Connector is for generation of multi-gene \nbackbone plasmids (see the detailed description of assembly scheme below). To simplify the \ntoolkit, we include a single reversed Assembly Connector, which we designate ConLS’ and its \ncognate forward version, ConLS (S for Start), although any numbered Assembly Connector \ncan have a reversed version if desired. \nFinally, the Type 1 parts in this toolkit also include an EcoRI and XbaI site for BioBrick compat-\nibility of the assembled cassettes and multi-gene plasmids. \nCCCT\n...GGTCTCA\nTTGC\n...CCAGAGTGGGA\nAACGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 1\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCCCTGAATTCGCATCTAGA(N)143CGTCTCANNNN(N)21\nBsmBI\nCTTAAGCGTAGATCT(N)143GCAGAGTNNNN(N)21TTGC\nEcoRI\nXbaI\nC\nCCCTGAATTCGCATCTAGANNNNTGAGACG(N)143\nBsmBI\nCTTAAGCGTAGATCTNNNNACTCTGC(N)143TTGC\nEcoRI\nXbaI\nSupplementary Figure S7\n\n===== Page 14 [text layer] =====\n\n14 \nType 2: Promoter \n \n \nType 2 parts are flanked by AACG and TATG (Supplementary Figure S8A). Typically, this \nType contains a promoter. The downstream overhang doubles as the start codon for the sub-\nsequent Type 3 or 3a coding sequence. Additionally, all the promoters in this toolkit have a \nBglII site immediately preceding the start codon (overlapping the downstream overhang) for \nBglBrick compatibility (Supplementary Figure S8B). \n \nType 3: Coding Sequence \n \n \nType 3 parts are flanked by TATG and ATCC (Supplementary Figure S9A). Typically, this \nType contains a coding sequence. As discussed above, the TATG overhang includes a start co-\ndon so coding sequences should begin with the second codon. The ATCC overhang was de-\nsigned to enable read-through for protein fusions. If a stop codon is omitted from the part, and \ntwo bases are added before the overhang, the resulting NNATCC can be used as a two amino \nacid linker to a Type 4 or 4a C-terminal fusion. The Type 3 parts in this toolkit all omit the stop \ncodon and add a GG, resulting in GGATCC, which serves a dual purpose. First, the resulting \nGly-Ser linker is relatively innocuous; and second, the sequence is a BamHI recognition site, \nwhich enables BglBrick compatibility (Supplementary Figure S9B). We highly recommend \nfollowing this convention unless the protein in question is sensitive to C-terminal modifica-\ntions. \nAACG\n...GGTCTCA\nATAC\n...CCAGAGTTTGC\nTATGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 2\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nAACGNNN...NNNAGATC\nNNN...NNNTCTAGATAC\nBglII\nPromoter\nTATG\n...GGTCTCA\nTAGG\n...CCAGAGTATAC\nATCCTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 3\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nTATGNNN...NNNGG\nNNN...NNNCCTAGG\nBamHI\nGly-Ser\nCDS\nSupplementary Figure S8 \nSupplementary Figure S9\n\n===== Page 15 [text layer] =====\n\n15 \nType 3a: N-terminal Coding Sequence \n \n \nType 3 parts can be split into 3a and 3b parts for greater flexibility for making protein fusions. \nType 3a parts are flanked by TATG and TTCT (Supplementary Figure S10A). As with Type 3 \nparts, these typically contain coding sequences, and can be used for fusing N-terminal tags \n(such as the degradation tags described in the main text). Again, as with Type 3 parts, the stop \ncodon should be omitted and two bases should be added before the TTCT overhang if protein \nfusions are desired. The Type 3a parts in this toolkit add a GG, resulting in GGTTCT, another \nGly-Ser linker (Supplementary Figure S10B). \n \nType 3b: Coding Sequence \n \n \nType 3b parts are flanked by TTCT and ATCC (Supplementary Figure S11A). As with Type 3 \nand 3a parts, these typically contain coding sequences. Again, the start codon should be re-\nmoved for direct fusions to the Type 3a preceding it, and two bases should be added before \nthe ATCC overhang if C-terminal fusions are desired. As with the Type 3 parts, all Type 3b \nparts in this toolkit add a GG, resulting in GGATCC (Gly-Ser/BamHI site) (Supplementary \nFigure S11B). \nTATG\n...GGTCTCA\nAAGA\n...CCAGAGTATAC\nTTCTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 3a\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nTATGNNN...NNNGG\nNNN...NNNCCAAGA\nGly-Ser\nCDS\nTTCT\n...GGTCTCA\nTAGG\n...CCAGAGTAAGA\nATCCTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 3b\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nTTCTNNN...NNNGG\nNNN...NNNCCTAGG\nBamHI\nGly-Ser\nCDS\nSupplementary Figure S10 \nSupplementary Figure S11\n\n===== Page 16 [text layer] =====\n\n16 \nType 4: Terminator \n \n \nType 4 parts are flanked by ATCC and GCTG (Supplementary Figure S12A). Typically, this \nType contains a transcriptional terminator. As described above, the convention for a Type 3 or \n3b is to omit the stop codon and allow read-through of a GGATCC (Gly-Ser) linker. Therefore, \nthe Type 4 should encode an in-frame stop codon before the transcriptional terminator. The \nType 4 parts in this toolkit begin with a TAA stop codon, followed by a XhoI site (CTCGAG, \nfor BglBrick compatibility), then the terminator sequence (Supplementary Figure S12B). \nCommonly used C-terminal fusions, such as purification or epitope tags, may be in included \nbefore the stop codon, but we recommend using the 4a/4b subtypes to maintain their modu-\nlarity. \n \nType 4a: C-terminal Coding Sequence \n \n \nLike Type 3 parts, Type 4 parts can be split into 4a and 4b parts for additional modularity. \nType 4a parts are flanked by ATCC and TGGC (Supplementary Figure S13A). Typically, this \nType contains a coding sequence for fusing to the C-terminus of a protein (such as a localiza-\ntion tag, fluorescent protein, or purification tag). However, in contrast to the Type 3 and 3b \nparts, the convention for 4a parts is to include the stop codon rather than enable read-through \nof the TGGC overhang (although this is possible if desired). As such, the Type 4a parts in this \ntoolkit end with a TAA stop codon, followed by a XhoI site (CTCGAG, for BglBrick compati-\nbility) (Supplementary Figure S13B). \nATCC\n...GGTCTCA\nCGAC\n...CCAGAGTTAGG\nGCTGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 4\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nATCCTAACTCGAGNNN...NNN\nATTGAGCTCNNN...NNNCGAC\nXhoI\nTerminator\nStop\nATCC\n...GGTCTCA\nACCG\n...CCAGAGTTAGG\nTGGCTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 4a\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nATCCNNN...NNNTAACTCGAG\nNNN...NNNATTGAGCTCACCG\nXhoI\nCDS\nStop\nSupplementary Figure S12 \nSupplementary Figure S13\n\n===== Page 17 [text layer] =====\n\n17 \nType 4b: Terminator \n \n \nType 4b parts are flanked by TGGC and GCTG (Supplementary Figure S14A). As with Type 4 \nparts, these typically contain transcriptional terminators (Supplementary Figure S14B). Be-\ncause the convention of a Type 4a part is to encode the stop codon, one is not necessary in a 4b \nand so only the terminator sequence is needed. \nType 5: 3’ Assembly Connector \n \n \nType 5 parts are flanked by GCTG and TACA (Supplementary Figure S15A). As with the \nType 1 parts, these parts typically contain Assembly Connectors. \nThe structure of Type 5 parts is very similar to that of Type 1 parts. First is an upstream-\ncutting BsmBI site (with a unique overhang), followed by a 143bp concatenated barcode se-\nquence (this structure is identical to that of the Type 1 ConLX’) (Supplementary Figure S15B). \nHere, the nomenclature used is “ConRX”. Again, there is a special structure for ConRX’ parts: \nthe 143bp sequence, a downstream-cutting BsmBI site, and a 20bp barcode (this structure is \nidentical to that of the Type 1 ConLX) (Supplementary Figure S15C). We included in this \ntoolkit, a single ConRE’ (E for end) part and its cognate forward version, ConRE. \nThe key to the Type 1 and 5 Assembly Connectors is that the unique overhangs generated by \nBsmBI digestion should match for parts with the same value of X. For example, the BsmBI \noverhang generated by ConL1 and by ConR1 is CCAA. This is critical for enabling assembly of \nmulti-gene plasmids, which is described in detail below. \nTGGC\n...GGTCTCA\nCGAC\n...CCAGAGTACCG\nGCTGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 4b\nBsaI\nBsaI\nB\nTGGCNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNCGAC\nTerminator\nA\nGCTG\n...GGTCTCA\nATGT\n...CCAGAGTCGAC\nTACATGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 5\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nC\nGCTG(N)143CGTCTCANNNN(N)21ACTAGTGCACTGCAG\nBsmBI\n(N)143GCAGAGTNNNN(N)21TGATCACGTGACGTCATGT\nSpeI\nPstI\nGCTGNNNNTGAGACG(N)143ACTAGTGCACTGCAG\nBsmBI\nNNNNACTCTGC(N)143TGATCACGTGACGTCATGT\nSpeI\nPstI\nSupplementary Figure S14 \nSupplementary Figure S15\n\n===== Page 18 [text layer] =====\n\n18 \nFinally, the Type 5 parts in this toolkit also include a SpeI (ACTAGT) and PstI (CTGCAG) site \nfor BioBrick compatibility of the assembled cassettes and multi-gene plasmids. \nType 6: Yeast Marker \n \n \nType 6 parts are flanked by TACA and GAGT (Supplementary Figure S16A). Typically, this \nType contains a selectable marker for S. cerevisiae. These parts should include the full expres-\nsion cassette (promoter, ORF, and terminator) for conferring the selectable phenotype (usually \namino acid prototrophy or drug-resistance) (Supplementary Figure S16B). \nType 7+8: Yeast Plasmid Propagation \nType 7 and 8 parts can be used in two ways, depending on the application. For plasmid ex-\npression in yeast, Type 7 and 8 parts should be used as described in this section; for integration \ninto the yeast chromosome, Type 7, 8a, and 8b parts should be used as described in the next \nsection. \n \n \nType 7 parts are flanked by GAGT and CCGA (Supplementary Figure S17A). For propagation \nof a stable plasmid in yeast, this Type contains a yeast origin of replication (Supplementary \nFigure S17B). Type 8 parts are flanked by CCGA and CCCT as well as NotI sites that are use-\nful for restriction mapping to verify new assemblies (Supplementary Figure S17A). This Type \ncontains a bacterial origin of replication and antibiotic resistance marker (Supplementary Fig-\nure S17B). \nTACA\n...GGTCTCA\nCTCA\n...CCAGAGTATGT\nGAGTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 6\nBsaI\nBsaI\nB\nTGGCNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNCGAC\nYeast marker\nA\nGAGT\n...GGTCTCA\nGGCT\n...CCAGAGTCTCA\nCCGATGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 7\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCCGA\n...GGTCTCA\nGGGA\n...CCAGAGTGGCT\nCCCTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 8\nType 7\nType 8\nBsaI\nBsaI\nGAGTNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNGGCT\nYeast origin\nNotI\nE. coli origin\nand marker\nNotI\nCCGAGCGGCCGCNNN...NNNGCGGCCGC\nCGCCGGCGNNN...NNNCGCCGGCGGGGA\nSupplementary Figure S16 \nSupplementary Figure S17\n\n===== Page 19 [text layer] =====\n\n19 \nType 7+8a+8b: Yeast Chromosomal Integration \n \n \nFor integration into the yeast chromosome, the Type 7 parts (which retain the GAGT and \nCCGA overhangs) contain sequences that have homology that is downstream (3’) of the target \nlocus (Supplementary Figure S18A). Longer homology sequences are more efficient at recom-\nbining into the chromosome; therefore, the parts in this toolkit contain 500bp of homology. \nAdditionally, a 20bp barcode sequence is included upstream of the homology region to serve \nas a forward primer binding site for colony PCR verification of integration into the correct lo-\ncus. \nType 8a parts are flanked by CCGA and CAAT (Supplementary Figure S18A). As with the \nType 8 parts, these typically contain a bacterial origin of replication and antibiotic resistance \nmarker (Supplementary Figure S17B). These parts are also flanked by NotI sites that can be \nused to linearize the integration plasmid prior to transformation into yeast (as well as for re-\nstriction mapping). \nType 8b parts are flanked by CAAT and CCCT (Supplementary Figure S18A). Similar to Type \n7 homology parts, these parts contain long sequences of homology to the genome that is up-\nstream (5’) of the target locus (Supplementary Figure S18B). Additionally, a 20bp barcode se-\nquence is included downstream of the homology region to serve as a reverse primer binding \nsite for colony PCR verification of integration into the correct locus. \nMiscellaneous \nIn addition to these standard part Types, non-standard Types that span two or more positions \ncan be constructed and are conventionally named as a concatenation of the Type numbers \nspanned. For example, some cassette plasmids are constructed only as intermediates toward a \nmulti-gene plasmid. These cassettes no longer require any of the yeast maintenance machinery \n(origin and marker) and so a Type 678 part that only contains a bacterial origin and marker \nmay be appropriate to use. \nA\nGAGT\n...GGTCTCA\nGGCT\n...CCAGAGTCTCA\nCCGATGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 7\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCCGA\n...GGTCTCA\nGTTA\n...CCAGAGTGGCT\nCAATTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 8a\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCAAT\n...GGTCTCA\nGGGA\n...CCAGAGTGTTA\nCCCTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 8b\nBsaI\nBsaI\nB\nGAGTNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNGGCT\n3’ Homology\n5’ Homology\nCAATNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNGGGA\nNotI\nE. coli origin\nand marker\nNotI\nCCGAGCGGCCGCNNN...NNNGCGGCCGC\nCGCCGGCGNNN...NNNCGCCGGCGGTTA\nType 7\nType 8a\nType 8b\nSupplementary Figure S18\n\n===== Page 20 =====\n\nDetailed Description of Hierarchical Assembly System\n\nThe construction of plasmids encoding multiple transcriptional units is done in three steps. The first is construction of part plasmids; second is assembly of cassette plasmids; and third is assembly of multi-gene plasmids (Figure 1).\n\nConstruction of Part Plasmids\n\nThe general structure of a part plasmid is as follows: 1) a downstream-facing Bsal site that generates the upstream flanking overhang of the part Type; 2) the part sequence; 3) an upstream-facing Bsal site that generates the downstream flanking overhang of the part Type; and 4) a ColE1 origin of replication and chloramphenicol resistance marker. Detailed descriptions for each part Type can be found in the Definition of Part Types.\n\nPart plasmids are assembled via a BsmBI Golden Gate reaction into the part entry vector (Supplementary Figure S19A). The entry vector contains a ColE1 origin of replication and chloramphenicol resistance marker, as well as a GFP expression dropout for green/white screening. Bsal, BsmBI, and NotI sites should be removed from all parts except in special cases. Additional restriction sites such as BbsI or the BioBrick/BglBrick enzymes may also be removed, but it is not necessary unless future use of those enzymes is anticipated.\n\nPrimers for amplifying preexisting templates should be designed as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S19A to enable BsmBI assembly into the entry vector, and subsequent Bsal cassette assemblies. The four N’s flanking the part should correspond to the flanking overhangs for the specific part Type (e.g., AACC and TATG for a Type 2). Modifications to the part sequence (e.g. restriction site removal) can be easily introduced by dividing the part into multiple DNA inserts in the BsmBI Golden Gate reaction. Internal overhangs in this reaction can be user-selected, but should avoid similarity to the entry vector overhangs TCGG and GACC. Parts made from de novo synthesis should mimic the same structure or be ordered in the entry vector. Finally, small parts can be assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides that drop directly into the entry vector (Supplementary Figure S19B). We routinely add annealed oligonucleotides and/or synthesized gene fragments (e.g. gBlocks®) directly to the BsmBI Golden Gate reaction.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{BsmBI} & \\xrightarrow{\\text{BSaI}} & \\text{BsmBI} \\\\\n\\text{GCATCGTCTCATCGGTCTCANNNN} & \\xrightarrow{\\text{Template}} & \\text{GFP} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{NNNNACTCTGGACTCTGCGGTA}} & \\text{TCGGCCAGACG} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{Bsal}} & \\text{BsmBI} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{AG}} & \\text{TC} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{TCAGCC}} & \\text{ColE1} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{BsmBI}} & \\text{CamR} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{BsmBI} & \\xrightarrow{\\text{TC}} & \\text{Entry vector} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{TC}} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{TC}} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nSupplementary Figure S19. Construction of new part plasmids.\n\n20\n\n===== Page 21 =====\n\nA special exception must be made for constructing new Assembly Connectors (Type 1 and 5). In these cases, the Assembly Connectors contain internal BsmBI sites used in multi-gene assemblies. There are two options for constructing these part plasmids. First, primers can be designed as normal, but the Golden Gate assembly protocol should be modified to exclude the final digestion and heat inactivation steps, thereby ending on a ligation. Second, an existing Type 1 or Type 5 plasmid can be digested and gel purified using Bsal, and the new part can then be assembled in using Bsal rather than BsmBI.\n\nAssembly of Cassette Plasmids\n\nThe simplest way to assemble a cassette is to include one part of each Type in a Bsal assembly. The Type 8 and 8a parts included in this toolkit serve as the canonical \"vectors\", and accordingly have an mRFP1 expression dropout for red/white screening.\n\nA\nConLS\nGFP dropout\n23d\nCsmR-ColE1\nCsmR-ColE1\nCsmR-ColE1\nURA3\n6\nCEN6/ARS4\n7\nCamR-ColE1\nRFP dropout\n8\nCamR-ColE1\nAmpR-ColE1\n\nB\nBsal assembly - end on ligation step Select green colonies on ampicillin\n\nC\n2\n3\n4\nConLS\nAmpR-ColE1\nCEN6/ARS4\nURA3\nConR1\nCamR-ColE1\nCamR-ColE1\nCamR-ColE1\n\nBsal assembly Select white colonies on ampicillin\n\nD\nSupplementary Figure S20. Assembly of cassette plasmids.\n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-assemble commonly used parts with a GFP dropout that spans the variable region. For example, a Type 234 GFP dropout part is included in this toolkit. By assembling ConLS, the GFP dropout, ConR1, URA3, CEN6/ARS4, and AmpR-ColE1, a cassette \"vector\" can be made (Supplementary Figure S20A and B). By storing this cassette, any future assemblies of transcriptional units (promoter, coding sequence, terminator) with these vector components will require fewer parts, something that is particularly useful for the generation of combinatorial libraries (Supplementary Figure S20C and D). It is important to note\n\n21\n\n===== Page 22 [text layer] =====\n\n22 \nthat the Type 234 GFP dropout part has BsaI sites in the reverse orientation that normal parts \ndo and will remain in the finished vector. Therefore, the Golden Gate assembly protocol \nshould be modified to exclude the final digestion and heat inactivation steps, thereby ending \non a ligation. We have observed a significantly higher rate of misassembly for this procedure \n(~50%). Incorrect products are typically concatenations of part plasmids and contain multiple \norigins of replication and antibiotics markers. Wrong products can be easily identified because \nthey will confer growth in media with either chloramphenicol or the desired antibiotic, where-\nas the correct product will not confer growth in media with chloramphenicol. \nAssembly of Multi-Gene Plasmids \nThe construction of a multi-gene plasmid from cassettes requires that the cassettes are flanked \nby unique pairs of Assembly Connectors, which dictate the order of assembly. The first cas-\nsette must contain the ConLS part, and the last cassette must contain the ConRE part. The or-\nder of internal Assembly Connectors can be arbitrary, although going in increasing numerical \norder is recommended to avoid confusion. Thus, before the individual cassettes are made, the \nstructure of the final multi-gene plasmid should be designed because it will determine which \nAssembly Connectors should be used during cassette assembly. \nFor example, if three transcriptional units, TU1, TU2, and TU3 are to be assembled into a mul-\nti-gene plasmid in that order, one possible design would be to flank TU1 with ConLS and \nConR1, TU2 with ConL1 and ConR2, and TU3 with ConL2 and ConRE (Supplementary Fig-\nure S21A). The “vector” into which these cassettes are assembled is itself another cassette, \nwhich uses the special ConLS’ and ConRE’ parts (Supplementary Figure S21B). One example \nof this special cassette is included in this toolkit, designed to target the URA3 locus for integra-\ntion. Again, in assembling this “vector” cassette, the Type 234 GFP dropout can be used to en-\nable green/white screening. When the final multi-gene plasmid is assembled, the Assembly \nConnector junctions leave behind 20bp barcode “scars”, which can be used to verify proper \nassembly by colony PCR or sequencing (Supplementary Figure S21C). \n \n \nOne issue with this style of assembly is that cassettes are locked into their position based on \nthe Assembly Connectors flanking them. For example, in the same three-TU multi-gene plas-\nmid described above, if TU2 were to be omitted, there would be a gap that would require reas-\nA\nB\nC\nConLS’\nURA3\nURA3\n3’ Hom\nURA3\n5’ Hom\nGFP dropout\nMulti-gene “vector”\nAssembled multi-gene plasmid\nKanR\nColE1\nConRE’\nConLS\nTU1\nAmpR-ColE1\nConR1\nConL1\nTU2\nAmpR-ColE1\nConR2\nConL2\nTU3\nAmpR-ColE1\nConRE\nTU2\nTU1\nTU3\nURA3\nURA3\n3’ Hom\nURA3\n5’ Hom\nKanR\nColE1\nSupplementary Figure S21.

One solution to this we provide in the toolkit is the Type 234 “Spacer” part. This part can be used to assemble filler cassettes—in this case, a ConL1-Spacer-ConR2 cassette. The advantage of assembling a filler cassette rather than a reassembled TU cassette is that the filler can be used again in future assemblies when that gap needs to be filled.\n\nConstruction of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs\n\nTo construct sgRNAs for targeting Cas9 to a site in the genome, we have provided a Type 234 sgRNA dropout, which is effectively an entry vector for these parts. This vector is based on the CRISPRm sgRNA architecture: a phenylalanine tRNA, a HDV ribozyme, a 20bp targeting sequence, the sgRNA, and an SNR52 terminator. For the dropout, the targeting sequence is replaced by a BsmBI-flanked GFP expression cassette. Unfortunately, the 4bp immediately upstream and downstream of the targeting sequence are CTTT and GTTT, which could incorrectly ligate, so the upstream overhang was moved two bases upstream to GACT. Consequently, two additional T’s should be added before the targeting sequence when ordering oligonucleotides to anneal and ligate into the dropout (Supplementary Figure S22). Once constructed, the sgRNA 234 part can be assembled into a cassette with appropriate connectors. This cassette should then be assembled into a multi-gene plasmid that also includes Cas9 expression and additional sgRNAs (optional).\n\nTwo annealing oligonucleotides\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{20bp targeting sequence} & \\text{BsmBI} \\\\\n\\text{GACTTTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN} & \\text{CGTCTCA} \\\\\n\\text{AANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN} & \\text{GCAGGTCAAA} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{Base} & \\text{GSNR52} & \\text{GCCTGAGACC} \\\\\n\\text{CGGTGACCC} & \\text{CGGAGCCTGG} & \\text{SgRNA dropout} \\\\\n\\text{CGGAGGTTGG} & \\text{HDV ribozyme} & \\text{(Type 234)} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{ColE1} & \\text{CamR} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nSupplementary Figure S22. Construction of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs.\n\nDifferences from MoClo\n\nThe hierarchical assembly system described in this work borrows heavily from the MoClo’ system with some modifications.\n\nFirst, the specific overhang sequences that flank the parts and the cassettes are different from those used by the MoClo creators. This change was made to support a greater number of part Types as well as the in-frame protein fusions enabled by several of those Types. Additionally, in an attempt to minimize assembly errors due to misligation of incompatible overhangs, we tried to find a more optimal set. It has been previously reported that when three out of four contiguous nucleotides match between two overhangs, a misligation event can occur (e.g., ATCG and ATCA). Furthermore, we had observed that even three non-contiguous matches could result in a misligation event (e.g., ATCG and ATAG, or ATCG and ATGA). Therefore, we tried to find a set of overhangs where the fewest such matches were present.\n\n23\n\n===== Page 24 =====\n\nSecond, the MoClo system requires an extensive series of vectors to support the various possibilities of multi-gene assemblies. Rather than creating the exhaustive set of possible vectors up front, our system utilizes the Assembly Connector parts to enable on-the-fly construction of vectors. One advantage of this approach is that rather than defining transcriptional units as being in Position 1, 2, 3..., they are defined as being between Assembly Connectors X and Y. Thus, a transcriptional unit could be cloned between ConL1 and ConR4, or ConL3 and ConR2, as long as the final sequence begins with ConLS and ends with ConRE and has no repeated Assembly Connectors.\n\nFinally, MoClo utilizes three Type IIs restriction enzymes to enable indefinite assembly of multiple transcriptional units. As described, our system is limited to one round of multi-gene assembly, although it could be extended to include this added functionality if desired. We have removed a third Type IIs restriction site (BbsI) from all parts in this toolkit for such purposes.\n\n### Alternative Assembly Methods\n\nAlthough Golden Gate is the preferred assembly method to be used in this system, there are a number of alternative methods that can be used at some steps of the process.\n\nThe initial part plasmid construction can be performed using any method, as long as the resulting plasmid has the appropriate BsaI overhangs flanking it.\n\nThe cassette plasmid assembly must be performed using Golden Gate. Other methods such as Gibson or SLIC can be used, but they will require unique primers for every new junction. Only Golden Gate assembly will preserve modularity at this step.\n\nOnce a cassette plasmid has been assembled, there is much more flexibility in terms of downstream assembly steps. If all the conventions described above are followed, the cassettes will be flanked by BioBrick restriction enzyme sites, enabling BioBrick cloning of cassettes with each other, or with existing BioBrick plasmids that have not been converted to this new system. Second, cassettes also contain BglBrick restriction enzyme sites that flank the coding sequence, enabling BglBrick cloning for fusing coding sequences with existing BglBrick parts. Third, the purpose of the 143bp sequences in the Assembly Connector parts is to facilitate modular recombination-based assembly methods, such as Gibson, SLIC, or _in vivo_ yeast assembly. As with the BsmBI overhangs in the Assembly Connectors, the 143bp sequences of ConLX and ConRX parts with the same value of X will be exactly the same, so cassettes can be designed in the same way for both Golden Gate and recombination-based assembly. Note that the final sequence of the multi-gene plasmid will be different depending on which method (Golden Gate, BioBrick, or recombination) is used for the assembly.\n\n### References\n\n(1) Shoemaker, D.

              "content": "First, I need to select the best FT variant for tracking yeast cell age. The target measurement window is 0-100 hours post-cell division. Yeast cell cycle is about 87 minutes, which is roughly 1.45 hours, so 100 hours covers many generations.\n\nNow, I have three FT variants: Fast-FT, Medium-FT, and Slow-FT. I need to estimate their maturation times in yeast at 30°C. The data provided is from in vitro at 37°C and from Drosophila S2 cells at 25°C. I need to decide which baseline is more similar for extrapolation to yeast at 30°C.\n\nKey factors:\n- Temperature: Yeast at 30°C vs. in vitro at 37°C (ΔT = -7°C) vs. S2 cells at 25°C (ΔT = +5°C). Temperature affects maturation rates with Q₁₀ ≈ 2.0, meaning for every 10°C change, rate doubles or halves.\n- Environment: Cellular environment has delays due to translation and degradation, making maturation times 5-10x longer than in vitro.\n\nSince yeast is a cellular system, the S2 cell data might be more representative because it includes cellular delays. However, S2 cells are at 25°C, and yeast is at 30°C, so I need to adjust for temperature.\n\nLet me calculate the temperature adjustment using Q₁₀ = 2.0.\n\nFor S2 cells at 25°C to yeast at 30°C, ΔT = +5°C. Since Q₁₀=2, for every 10°C, rate doubles, so for +5°C, rate should increase by a factor of 2^(5/10) = 2^0.5 ≈ 1.414. So maturation times should decrease by a factor of 1/1.414 ≈ 0.707.\n\nFor in vitro at 37°C to yeast at 30°C, ΔT = -7°C. So rate should decrease by 2^(-7/10) = 2^-0.7 ≈ 1/2^0.7 ≈ 1/1.624 ≈ 0.616. So maturation times should increase by a factor of 1/0.616 ≈ 1.624.\n\nBut in vitro times are already without cellular delays, so for cellular times, I need to apply the 5-10x extension.\n\nThe literature says: \"In cellular environments: Maturation times are ~5-10x longer than in vitro due to translation delays and degradation\"\n\nAlso, from the FT paper, in S2 cells at 25°C, the times are much longer than in vitro at 37°C. For example, Fast-FT in vitro at 37°C: blue peak at 0.25h, red half-max at 7.1h. In S2 cells at 25°C: blue peak at ~13h, red development over ~200h. So for Fast-FT, in vitro red half-max is 7.1h at 37°C, in S2 cells, red is still developing at 200h, so indeed much longer.\n\nSimilarly, for Medium-FT, in vitro red half-max at 37°C is 3.9h, in S2 cells at 25°C, red half-max at ~197h? From Figure 3, for Medium-FT in S2 cells, red fluorescence peaks around 197h? Let's see the text: \"The maxima of the red fluorescence were achieved at 200 h with fast-FT (a) and 197 h with medium-FT (b).\" So red maxima at 197h for Medium-FT in S2 cells at 25°C.\n\nBut in vitro, red half-max is at 3.9h for Medium-FT at 37°C. So the cellular times are about 50x longer for red development? That seems higher than 5-10x. Let's check Fast-FT: in vitro red half-max 7.1h, in S2 red max at 200h, but half-max might be earlier. From the kinetics, it's not directly half-max, but from the curves, in S2 cells, red fluorescence is still increasing at 200h for Fast-FT, so half-max would be less than 200h, but still, it's much longer.\n\nPerhaps for red half-max, in cells, it's delayed. But from the model, in cells, there is degradation, so red fluorescence decreases after peak, so half-max might not be directly comparable.\n\nI need to focus on the ratio r(t) = R/(B+R).\n\nFor the purpose of timer, we care about how r(t) changes over time.\n\nFrom the in vitro data, we have maturation kinetics, and in cells, we have similar behavior but with extended times due to translation and degradation.\n\nThe key point is that in cells, the apparent maturation is slower because of ongoing translation and degradation.\n\nFor yeast, I need to estimate the maturation times at 30°C.\n\nLet me first decide which baseline to use. The S2 cell data is at 25°C and includes cellular effects, so it might be more directly applicable after temperature adjustment to 30°C.\n\nThe in vitro data is at 37°C and is for purified proteins, so without cellular effects, so if I use in vitro, I need to apply the 5-10x extension and temperature adjustment.\n\nBut the 5-10x extension is from in vitro to cellular, and from S2 data, for Fast-FT, in vitro red half-max 7.1h at 37°C, in S2 at 25°C, red fluorescence peaks at 200h? But red half-max should be before peak. From the model, in cells, red fluorescence increases and then decreases due to degradation, so the time to reach half-max of red might be different.\n\nFrom the FT paper, in HeLa cells at 37°C, for slow-FT, blue peak at 17h and red peak at 41h (from Figure 4b). In vitro at 37°C, slow-FT blue peak at 9.8h and red half-max at 28h. So in HeLa cells, blue peak at 17h vs in vitro 9.8h, so about 1.7x longer, and red peak at 41h vs red half-max at 28h, but red half-max is not the same as peak, but in vitro, red reaches plateau, so half-max is at 28h, while in cells, red peaks at 41h, so similar times? But in cells, there is degradation, so the times are comparable or slightly longer.\n\nFrom the text: \"In cellular environments: Maturation times are ~5-10x longer than in vitro due to translation delays and degradation\"\n\nBut from HeLa data, for slow-FT, in vitro blue peak 9.8h, in HeLa blue peak 17h, so about 1.7x, not 5-10x. Similarly, for red, in vitro red half-max 28h, in HeLa red peak 41h, so half-max would be less than 41h, say 20h, so similar to 28h? This is confusing.\n\nLet's look at the S2 data at 25°C. For slow-FT in S2, blue peak at 80h, red development beyond 200h. In vitro at 37°C, blue peak at 9.8h. So from in vitro 37°C to S2 25°C, temperature difference of -12°C, so rate should decrease by 2^(-12/10) = 2^-1.2 ≈ 1/2.3 ≈ 0.435, so times increase by 2.3x. But blue peak from 9.8h to 80h is about 8x longer, so additional factor due to cellular effects. Similarly for red, in vitro red half-max 28h, in S2 red still increasing at 200h, so times are much longer.\n\nSo for S2 cells, the cellular delays are significant, probably due to the lower temperature and different cell type.\n\nFor yeast, at 30°C, which is closer to 25°C than 37°C, and yeast is a microbial cell, so perhaps cellular delays are similar to S2 cells but with temperature adjustment.\n\nI think for consistency, I should use the S2 cell data as baseline because it includes cellular effects, and adjust for temperature to 30°C.\n\nSo for S2 cells at 25°C, I have data for each FT:\n\nFrom Figure 3 and text:\n\n- Fast-FT in S2 at 25°C: blue peak at 13h, red fluorescence peaks at 200h? But from the curve, red is still increasing at 200h, so let's find red half-max. From the model, in cells, red fluorescence increases to a peak and then decreases, so for timer, we care about the ratio, not absolute fluorescence.\n\nFrom the ratio curves in vitro, we have r(t) based on red and blue.\n\nIn cells, the ratio r(t) can be calculated from the kinetics.\n\nFor simplicity, I can use the in vitro maturation times as a reference for the intrinsic maturation rates, and then for cellular expression, the apparent r(t) will depend on the expression strategy.\n\nBut for FT selection, I need to see how r(t) changes over time for a cohort of proteins expressed at time zero.\n\nSo let's consider the intrinsic maturation kinetics from in vitro data, and then for cellular expression, if we have constitutive expression, r(t) will reach a steady state, and if periodic, r(t) will reflect the age of the protein cohort.\n\nThe key parameter for timer is how r(t) changes with time since expression.\n\nFrom the in vitro data, we have the maturation curves for B and R.\n\nFrom the kinetic model: C -> B -> I -> R, with rate constants.\n\nBut for r(t) = R/(B+R), I need to find how this ratio changes over time for a pulse of expression.\n\nFrom the in vitro data, we have the time to blue peak and red half-max.\n\nFor a pulse of expression at t=0, the proteins mature, and B increases and then decreases, R increases slowly.\n\nThe ratio r(t) starts at 0 and increases to 1 as all proteins mature to red.\n\nThe rate of increase of r(t) depends on the maturation rate.\n\nFrom the in vitro ratio curves in Figure 2d-f, for Fast-FT at 37°C, r(t) increases rapidly, for Slow-FT, it increases slowly.\n\nBut these are for purified proteins, so no synthesis or degradation.\n\nIn cells, with degradation, the ratio might behave differently, but for a pulse, it should be similar if degradation is slow compared to maturation.\n\nFrom the cellular data, for cytoplasmically expressed FTs in HeLa cells with Tet-Off, after transcription stop, we see the blue and red fluorescence changes, which reflect maturation and degradation.\n\nFor example, for slow-FT in HeLa at 37°C, blue peaks at 17h and red at 41h after doxycycline addition.\n\nBut after doxycycline, transcription stops, so it's like a pulse, and then we observe the cohort maturing.\n\nSo for a pulse, the ratio r(t) can be calculated from the B and R levels.\n\nFrom the HeLa data for slow-FT, at t=17h, blue peaks, so B is max, and R is growing, so r(t) is small, at t=41h, red peaks, so R is max, and B is decreasing, so r(t) is larger.\n\nBut for timer, we want r(t) to change significantly over the time window of interest.\n\nFor yeast, the time window is 0-100 hours, which is long, so we need an FT that has significant change in r(t) over 100 hours.\n\nNow, let's estimate the maturation times in yeast at 30°C.\n\nI need to choose a baseline. Since yeast is cellular, and S2 data is available at 25°C, I'll use S2 data and adjust to 30°C.\n\nFrom S2 data at 25°C:\n\n- Fast-FT: blue peak at 13h, red fluorescence peaks at 200h? But from Figure 3a, for Fast-FT, blue peaks at 13h, and red is still increasing at 200h, so red half-max might be around 100h or more? From the curve, red fluorescence at 200h is about 80% of max? But max is at 200h? It says \"the maxima of the red fluorescence were achieved at 200 h\", so for Fast-FT, red max at 200h.\n\nSimilarly for Medium-FT, red max at 197h.\n\nFor Slow-FT, red development beyond 200h, so red max after 200h.\n\nBut for ratio, we need B and R.\n\nFrom the kinetics, after blue peak, B decreases, and R increases.\n\nSo for a pulse, the time when r(t) = 0.5 depends on the maturation rate.\n\nFrom in vitro data, we have red half-max, which is the time when R reaches half its maximum, but for a pulse, since R eventually decreases due to degradation, in cells, the red half-max might not be directly related.\n\nFor timer, the important thing is the ratio r(t).\n\nFrom the in vitro ratio curves, we can see how r(t) changes with time.\n\nBut in vitro, there is no degradation, so r(t) eventually reaches 1.\n\nIn cells, with degradation, r(t) might not reach 1 if degradation is fast, but for FTs, degradation is slow, from HeLa data, for slow-FT, red peaks at 41h after transcription stop, and doxycycline was added at 7h after transfection, so total time from transfection to red peak is 48h, but since transcription stops at 7h, the protein cohort ages.\n\nFrom the model, the degradation rate k_D for slow-FT in HeLa at 37°C is 4.8e-2 h^{-1} from Supplementary Table 2, so half-life of red form is ln2/k_D = 0.693/0.048 ≈ 14.4 hours, so degradation is significant.\n\nSo for cellular FTs, the ratio r(t) for a pulse will increase and then decrease as proteins degrade, but since B and R degrade at similar rates, perhaps r(t) stabilizes or something.\n\nFrom the HeLa data for slow-FT, from Figure 4b, blue fluorescence peaks at 17h and then decreases, red peaks at 41h and then decreases, so both B and R decrease due to degradation, so r(t) = R/(B+R) might increase and then approach a constant if B and R decrease at the same rate, but since R matures from B, the ratio might continue to increase until all B is converted, but with degradation, it's complex.\n\nFor simplicity, for timer application, we assume that the maturation is much faster than degradation, or vice versa, but from data, degradation half-life is 14.4h for slow-FT, and maturation time for red is 28h in vitro at 37°C for half-max, so in cells, it's similar, so both timescales are comparable.\n\nFor yeast, typical protein half-lives can vary, but for expressed FTs, we can assume similar degradation.\n\nBut for FT selection, I need to find which FT gives the largest change in r(t) over 0-100 hours for a pulse of expression.\n\nSo let's first estimate the intrinsic maturation times for FTs in yeast at 30°C.\n\nI will use the in vitro data at 37°C as baseline for intrinsic maturation, because it's controlled, and then apply temperature adjustment to 30°C, and then for cellular expression, the apparent times might be longer due to translation delays, but for a pulse, if we assume instant expression, the maturation should follow intrinsic kinetics plus degradation.\n\nFrom the literature: \"Maturation times are ~5-10x longer than in vitro due to translation delays and degradation\" – this might be for the apparent times in continuous expression, but for a pulse, the maturation times should be similar to in vitro if we consider the protein age from synthesis.\n\nIn the cellular experiments with Tet-Off, after transcription stop, the proteins are synthesized from existing mRNA, so there is a delay in synthesis, but once synthesized, the maturation should start.\n\nFrom the kinetic model in cells, they have k_C for translation rate.\n\nFor a pulse of expression, if we assume that all proteins are synthesized at t=0, then the maturation should follow the in vitro kinetics, but with possible cellular effects on rate, but the paper says that FTs show similar timing behavior in different cell types, so the intrinsic maturation rates are likely similar across cells.\n\nSo for simplicity, I will use the in vitro data at 37°C and adjust to 30°C for intrinsic maturation rates.\n\nThen for a pulse of proteins at t=0, I can compute r(t) from the maturation kinetics.\n\nFrom the in vitro data, we have blue peak time and red half-max time.\n\nFor the ratio r(t), from the kinetic model, we can find an expression.\n\nFrom the model: C -> B -> I -> R, with rates k_B, k_I, k_R.\n\nBut for r(t) = R/(B+R), since I is non-fluorescent, we need B and R.\n\nFrom the in vitro curves, for Fast-FT at 37°C, blue peaks at 0.25h, red half-max at 7.1h.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe red half-max is the time when R reaches half of its maximum, but since there is no degradation, R maximum is when all proteins are in R state, so for a pulse, R(t) = 1 - B(t) - I(t) - C(t), but eventually R=1.\n\nSo red half-max is when R=0.5.\n\nSimilarly, blue peak is when B is maximum.\n\nFor the ratio r(t) = R/(B+R), at early times, B is large, R is small, r≈0, at late times, B=0, R=1, r=1.\n\nSo the time it takes for r to go from 0 to 1 depends on the maturation rate.\n\nFrom the ratio curves in Figure 2d-f, for Fast-FT at 37°C, r(t) reaches 0.5 at around 1h? From Figure 2d, at 37°C, for Fast-FT, r(t) seems to reach 0.5 at about 0.5h? But the time axis is in hours, and at 0.1h, r is very small, at 1h, r is large, but let's estimate.\n\nFrom Figure 2d, for Fast-FT at 37°C, at t=0.1h, r≈0.1, at t=1h, r≈0.8, so quickly.\n\nFor Medium-FT at 37°C, from Figure 2e, at t=1h, r≈0.2, at t=10h, r≈0.8.\n\nFor Slow-FT at 37°C, from Figure 2f, at t=10h, r≈0.2, at t=100h, r≈0.8.\n\nSo for Slow-FT, r(t) changes significantly over 10-100 hours.\n\nFor yeast, time window 0-100 hours, so Slow-FT might be good because r(t) changes over this range.\n\nBut we need at 30°C, so adjust times.\n\nFirst, from in vitro at 37°C to yeast at 30°C, temperature difference -7°C, so rate decrease factor: 2^(-7/10) = 2^-0.7 ≈ 1/1.624 ≈ 0.616, so times increase by 1/0.616 ≈ 1.624 times.\n\nSo for Slow-FT at 30°C, in vitro, blue peak would be at 9.8h * 1.624 ≈ 15.9h, red half-max at 28h * 1.624 ≈ 45.5h.\n\nBut this is in vitro, for cellular, we have additional delays, but for a pulse of proteins, the maturation should be similar to in vitro if we consider from synthesis time.\n\nIn cellular environment, the maturation might be slower due to crowding etc., but from the paper, in HeLa cells at 37°C, for slow-FT, blue peaks at 17h after transcription stop, which is similar to in vitro blue peak at 9.8h? But in HeLa, it's after transcription stop, so proteins are synthesized over time, so blue peaks later.\n\nFrom HeLa data for slow-FT at 37°C, blue peaks at 17h after doxycycline, and doxycycline was added at 7h after transfection, so from transfection, blue peaks at 24h, while in vitro blue peak at 9.8h, so longer, but this includes synthesis time.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, after transcription stop, mRNA decays, and proteins are synthesized, so the peak blue time includes the time for synthesis and maturation.\n\nFor a pulse where all proteins are synthesized at t=0, the blue peak time should be similar to in vitro blue peak time.\n\nIn HeLa, with Tet-Off, after doxycycline, transcription stops, but mRNA persists, so proteins are synthesized for several hours, so it's not a sharp pulse.\n\nFor yeast, if we use a periodic promoter that expresses briefly, we can approximate it as a pulse.\n\nSo for FT selection, I will use the in vitro data at 37°C and adjust to 30°C for intrinsic maturation times, and then for a pulse, compute r(t) over time.\n\nThen see which FT has the largest Δr over 0-100 hours.\n\nBut since the time window is 0-100 hours, and yeast cell cycle is 1.45h, for lineage tracking, we care about age from birth, so for a daughter cell, at birth, proteins are inherited from mother, but if we use a promoter expressed at birth, then new proteins are synthesized at birth, so the timer reflects age from birth.\n\nSo for a pulse at t=0 (birth), we want r(t) to change with t.\n\nNow, for each FT, let's estimate the red half-max time at 30°C from in vitro data.\n\nFirst, from in vitro at 37°C:\n\n- Fast-FT: red half-max = 7.1 h\n- Medium-FT: red half-max = 3.9 h\n- Slow-FT: red half-max = 28 h\n\nAt 30°C, times scale by factor 1.624, so:\n\n- Fast-FT: red half-max = 7.1 * 1.624 ≈ 11.5 h\n- Medium-FT: red half-max = 3.9 * 1.624 ≈ 6.3 h\n- Slow-FT: red half-max = 28 * 1.624 ≈ 45.5 h\n\nNow, for a pulse of proteins at t=0, the ratio r(t) = R/(B+R). From the kinetic model, if we assume that the maturation from B to R is a single step with effective rate constant, then R(t) = 1 - e^{-k t} for some k, but actually, from the model, it's more complex.\n\nFrom the red half-max time, let's define the time constant for red maturation. If red half-max is t_red, then for exponential approach, k = ln2 / t_red.\n\nBut from the model, R(t) increases sigmoidally, but for simplicity, we can approximate r(t) ≈ 1 - e^{- (ln2) t / t_red } for times after blue peak, but since blue peaks early, for t > blue peak, B is decreasing, R is increasing, so r(t) increases.\n\nFrom the in vitro ratio curves, for Slow-FT, r(t) increases from 0 to 1 over about 10-100 hours at 37°C.\n\nAt 30°C, times are 1.624 times longer, so for Slow-FT, r(t) increases from 0 to 1 over about 16-162 hours.\n\nSimilarly for Fast-FT, at 30°C, r(t) increases from 0 to 1 over about 0.4-18 hours? From in vitro at 37°C, for Fast-FT, r(t) goes from 0 to 1 in about 1 hour, so at 30°C, in 1.624 hours, so too fast for 100-hour window.\n\nFor Medium-FT, at 37°C, r(t) goes from 0 to 1 in about 10 hours, so at 30°C, in 16 hours, so for 100-hour window, it would saturate quickly.\n\nFor Slow-FT, at 37°C, r(t) goes from 0 to 1 in about 100 hours, so at 30°C, in 162 hours, so over 100 hours, r(t) would change from say 0 to 0.6, so Δr ≈ 0.6.\n\nFor Fast-FT, over 100 hours, r(t) would be 1 for most of the time, so Δr ≈ 0.\n\nFor Medium-FT, over 100 hours, r(t) would be 1 after 16 hours, so for t>16h, r=1, so Δr from 0 to 1 over first 16h, but after that, no change, so for window 0-100h, average Δr might be small, but since we care about change over time, for age tracking, we want r(t) to be monotonic and changing over the window.\n\nSo for Slow-FT, r(t) changes significantly over 0-100 hours at 30°C.\n\nNow, for cellular expression, with degradation, r(t) might not reach 1, but for Slow-FT, since maturation is slow, degradation might affect, but let's see.\n\nFrom HeLa data at 37°C for Slow-FT, after transcription stop, r(t) increases, but from Figure 4b, we have B and R, but not ratio. From Supplementary Figure 3 for Medium-FT, we have B and R, but not ratio.\n\nFrom the LAMP-2A study, they use the ratio to determine age.\n\nSo for yeast, with Slow-FT, at 30°C, for a pulse, r(t) should increase from 0 to around 0.6 over 100 hours, so Δr ≈ 0.6, which is good.\n\nFor Fast-FT, r(t) would increase to 1 within hours, so for most of the 100 hours, r(t)=1, no change, so not useful.\n\nSimilarly for Medium-FT, r(t) increases to 1 within 16 hours, so for t>16h, r=1, so for cells older than 16h, no discrimination.\n\nSince yeast cell cycle is 1.45h, after 16 hours, many generations have passed, so for age tracking, we want to distinguish cells from birth to several generations, so Slow-FT allows discrimination over multiple generations.\n\nTherefore, Slow-FT is the best choice for yeast age tracking over 0-100 hours.\n\nNow, for the quantitative assessment, I need to compute Δr for Slow-FT.\n\nLet me estimate r(t) for Slow-FT at 30°C.\n\nFrom in vitro at 37°C, from Figure 2f, r(t) can be approximated. At t=0, r=0, at t=10h, r≈0.2, at t=100h, r≈0.8.\n\nSince the ratio curve is parabolic, but for simplicity, let's assume that r(t) = 1 - exp(-t / τ) for some τ.\n\nFrom red half-max, when R=0.5, but r(t) depends on B and R.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, for Slow-FT, from Supplementary Table 2, at 37°C, k_B=4.8e-2 h^{-1}, k_I=1.9e-1 h^{-1}, k_R=1.4e-1 h^{-1}. But these are for the states.\n\nFor a pulse at t=0, all proteins in C state, then B(t), R(t) can be solved.\n\nBut for r(t), it's complicated.\n\nFrom the ratio curve in Figure 2f, for Slow-FT at 37°C, r(t) seems linear on log-time? But let's find when r=0.5.\n\nFrom Figure 2f, at 37°C, for Slow-FT, r=0.5 at approximately t=50h? Let's see the axis: from 0.1 to 100 hours, and r from 0 to 1, so at t=10h, r=0.2, at t=100h, r=0.8, so at t=50h, r=0.5? But it's log scale? No, it's linear time axis? From the figure, it seems linear time from 0 to 100 hours for Slow-FT, so at t=10h, r=0.2, at t=100h, r=0.8, so roughly linear? So r(t) ≈ 0.2 + (0.6/90)t for t>10h? But from t=0 to 10h, r increases from 0 to 0.2.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that for Slow-FT, r(t) ≈ 0.01 * t for t in hours? But at t=100, r=1, so r(t) ≈ t/100 for 0<t<100? But from figure, at t=10, r=0.2, so not linear.\n\nFrom the curve, it seems that r(t) increases slowly initially and then faster, but from the model, it should be s-shaped.\n\nFrom the red half-max time, for Slow-FT, red half-max is 28h at 37°C, but red half-max is when R=0.5, but r(t) = R/(B+R), when R=0.5, if B is small, r≈1, but when R=0.5, B might be significant.\n\nFrom the kinetics, when R reaches half-max, B is already decreasing.\n\nFrom in vitro data for Slow-FT at 37°C, from Figure 2c, blue peaks at 9.8h, and at that time, R is small, so r is small. When R half-max at 28h, blue is low, so r is large.\n\nFrom Figure 2c, at t=28h, for Slow-FT, B is almost zero, R is 0.5, so r≈1? But from ratio curve, at t=28h, r should be high.\n\nFrom Figure 2f, at t=28h, r is about 0.4? Let's estimate from Figure 2f: at t=10h, r=0.2, at t=30h, r=0.4, at t=100h, r=0.8. So approximately r(t) = 0.2 * log10(t) + c? But at t=10, r=0.2, at t=100, r=0.8, so change of 0.6 over log10(100)-log10(10)=1, so dr/dlogt = 0.6, so r(t) = 0.6 log10(t) - 0.4? But at t=10, log10(10)=1, so r=0.6-0.4=0.2, at t=100, log10(100)=2, r=1.2-0.4=0.8, yes. So for Slow-FT at 37°C, r(t) ≈ 0.6 log10(t) - 0.4 for t from 10 to 100 hours.\n\nBut at t=1, log10(1)=0, r=-0.4, which is not possible, so for t<10h, r is small.\n\nFor our purpose, for t from 0 to 100h, we can use this approximation for t>10h, and for t<10h, r is small.\n\nAt t=0, r=0.\n\nSo for Slow-FT at 37°C, from t=0 to 10h, r increases from 0 to 0.2, and from t=10 to 100h, r increases from 0.2 to 0.8.\n\nSo over 0-100h, Δr = 0.8 - 0 = 0.8.\n\nBut at t=100h, r=0.8, not 1.\n\nNow at 30°C, times are 1.624 times longer, so time scale is stretched by 1.624.\n\nSo for Slow-FT at 30°C, r(t) at time t corresponds to r at time t/1.624 at 37°C.\n\nSo at yeast time t, r(t) = r_37(t / 1.624)\n\nWhere r_37 is the ratio at 37°C.\n\nFrom above, r_37(t) ≈ 0.6 log10(t) - 0.4 for t=10 to 100 hours.\n\nBut at 37°C, for t=100, r=0.8, so for Slow-FT, at 37°C, r never reaches 1? From Figure 2f, at t=100h, r=0.8, and it seems to be increasing, so at t=1000h, r=1, but practically, for 100 hours, r=0.8.\n\nAt 30°C, for t=100 hours, equivalent to 37°C time of 100/1.624 ≈ 61.6 hours.\n\nAt 37°C, t=61.6h, what is r? From r_37(t) = 0.6 log10(t) - 0.4, for t=61.6, log10(61.6)≈1.79, so r=0.6*1.79 -0.4 = 1.074 -0.4 = 0.674? But from Figure 2f, at t=60h, r is about 0.5? Let's use the values from Figure 2f: at t=10h, r=0.2, at t=30h, r=0.4, at t=100h, r=0.8, so let's assume linear between log t? But log t from 1 to 2, r from 0.2 to 0.8, so at log t=1.3, r=0.2 + (0.6/1)(0.3) = 0.2+0.18=0.38? So for t=20h, log10(20)=1.3, r=0.38? From Figure, at t=20h, r=0.3? I think it's better to use the red half-max.\n\nFor timer, the change in r(t) is what matters.\n\nFor Slow-FT, at 37°C, over 0-100h, r changes from 0 to 0.8, so Δr=0.8.\n\nAt 30°C, over 0-100h, since times are longer, r changes less over 100h. At 30°C, the time to reach r=0.8 is 100*1.624=162.4 hours, so over 100 hours, r reaches r_37(100/1.624) = r_37(61.6) . From earlier, r_37(61.6) ≈ from interpolation: at t=30h, r=0.4, at t=100h, r=0.8, so at t=61.6h, r=0.4 + (0.8-0.4)/(100-30)*(61.6-30) = 0.4 + 0.4/70 *31.6 = 0.4 + 0.005714*31.6 ≈ 0.4 + 0.1806 = 0.5806. So r≈0.58 at t=61.6h at 37°C.\n\nSo at 30°C, at t=100h, r=0.58.\n\nAt t=0, r=0.\n\nSo Δr over 0-100h = 0.58 - 0 = 0.58.\n\nSimilarly, for Medium-FT at 37°C, from Figure 2e, at t=1h, r=0.2, at t=10h, r=0.8, so over 0-10h, Δr=0.8. At 30°C, times scaled by 1.624, so over 0-10*1.624=16.24h, Δr=0.8, so over 0-100h, for t>16.24h, r=1, so Δr from 0 to 1 over first 16.24h, but for the window 0-100h, the change is only from 0 to 1, but since it saturates early, for cells after 16h, r=1, so no discrimination. The average change over the window might be low, but for age tracking, we want r(t) to be different for different ages, so if after 16h all cells have r=1, then we cannot distinguish ages after 16h.\n\nSimilarly for Fast-FT, after few hours, r=1.\n\nSo for Slow-FT, over 0-100h, r changes from 0 to 0.58, so for age t, r(t) is different, so good discrimination.\n\nTherefore, Slow-FT is best.\n\nNow for the other FTs, let's compute Δr over 0-100h at 30°C.\n\nFor Fast-FT at 37°C, from Figure 2d, at t=0.1h, r=0.1, at t=1h, r=0.8, so over 0-1h, Δr=0.7. At 30°C, times scaled by 1.624, so over 0-1.624h, Δr=0.7, so over 0-100h, for t>1.624h, r=1, so Δr over 0-100h is effectively 1, but since it saturates quickly, the useful change is only up to 1.624h, so for age tracking, only young cells can be distinguished, but for older cells, all have r=1, so not good.\n\nSimilarly for Medium-FT, over 0-16.24h, Δr=0.8, so for ages up to 16h, discrimination, but after that, no.\n\nFor yeast, with cell cycle 1.45h, after 16h, about 11 generations, so for lineage tracking, we might want to track over multiple generations, so Slow-FT allows discrimination up to 100 hours, which is about 69 generations, so good.\n\nTherefore, I select Slow-FT.\n\nNow for the quantitative assessment, I'll compute Δr for Slow-FT over 0-100h at 30°C as 0.58.\n\nFor Medium-FT, over 0-100h, since it saturates at 16.24h, r=1 after that, so the change is only from 0 to 1, but the range of r over the window is from 0 to 1, but the derivative dr/dt is large only early, so for age discrimination, the sensitivity dr/dt is important.\n\nBut for now, since the window is 0-100h, we want r(t) to be monotonic and changing throughout, so Slow-FT is best.\n\nSo FT type selection: Slow-FT.\n\nNow, for promoter strategy.\n\nWe have two options: periodic promoter or constitutive promoter.\n\nWith constitutive promoter, there is continuous expression, so at steady state, there is a mix of proteins of different ages, so the ratio r(t) for the cell would be constant, not changing with cell age, so it would not work for age tracking.\n\nFor age tracking, we need the timer to reflect the time since a specific event, such as birth. So if we use a promoter that expresses only at birth, then the protein cohort ages with the cell, and r(t) changes with cell age.\n\nIf we use constitutive promoter, then new proteins are always being synthesized, so the age distribution of proteins is uniform, and r(t) is constant.\n\nTherefore, for timer function, we must use a periodic promoter that expresses briefly at cell birth.\n\nSo promoter strategy: periodic promoter.\n\nNow, for pulse optimization.\n\nIf periodic promoter, we need to choose the pulse characteristics: duration and timing.\n\nTiming should be at cell birth, so that the protein cohort starts aging from birth.\n\nDuration: how long the expression window is.\n\nIf the pulse is too short, we have a sharp cohort, but might have low signal.\n\nIf the pulse is too long, the cohort has a range of ages, so the r(t) will be an average over ages, reducing the temporal resolution.\n\nSo for best temporal resolution, we want a short pulse.\n\nBut practical constraints: yeast cell cycle is short, 87 minutes, so the pulse should be much shorter than the cell cycle to avoid overlap with next generation.\n\nAlso, from FT maturation, since Slow-FT matures slowly, even a pulse of 30 minutes might be fine, as the age scale is hours.\n\nNow, quantitatively, let's see how pulse width affects the sharpness of r(t).\n\nSuppose the pulse has duration Δt, and we assume uniform synthesis during Δt.\n\nThen at time t after birth, the proteins have ages from t to t-Δt if t>Δt, or from 0 to t if t<Δt.\n\nThen the total B and R at time t are integrals over the cohort.\n\nThen r(t) = R(t) / (B(t) + R(t))\n\nSince the maturation is slow, for small Δt, the cohort is almost simultaneous, so r(t) reflects the age t.\n\nFor larger Δt, r(t) reflects the average age from t-Δt to t, so for example, at time t, r(t) is similar to r(t - Δt/2), so the effective age is shifted, and the resolution is reduced.\n\nThe change in r(t) with t is diluted.\n\nSo for best resolution, Δt should be as small as possible.\n\nBut there is a trade-off with signal strength: shorter pulse means fewer proteins synthesized, so lower fluorescence, hence higher noise.\n\nAlso, practical limits: how short a pulse can be achieved with yeast promoters. Typically, promoters can be induced for short periods, but since cell cycle is short, pulse width should be a fraction of cell cycle.\n\nLet's say pulse width of 10-30 minutes might be achievable.\n\nNow, for Slow-FT, maturation time scale is hours, so Δt=30 minutes is about 0.5 hours, which is small compared to 100 hours, so it should be fine.\n\nNow, quantitatively, let's estimate the effect on Δr.\n\nSuppose without pulse, for a delta pulse, r(t) as before.\n\nWith pulse width Δt, the apparent r_app(t) = average of r(u) for u from max(0,t-Δt) to t.\n\nThen dr_app/dt = [ r(t) - r(t-Δt) ] / Δt approximately.\n\nSo the derivative is reduced by a factor of up to 1/Δt if r is linear, but since r(t) is slowly changing, for small Δt, it's ok.\n\nFor example, for Slow-FT, r(t) changes from 0 to 0.58 over 100 hours, so average dr/dt = 0.58/100 = 0.0058 per hour.\n\nIf Δt=0.5 hours, then the difference r(t) - r(t-0.5) ≈ 0.0058 * 0.5 = 0.0029, so dr_app/dt ≈ 0.0029 / 0.5 = 0.0058 per hour, same as actual, so no loss of resolution.\n\nIf Δt=5 hours, then r(t) - r(t-5) ≈ 0.0058 * 5 = 0.029, dr_app/dt ≈ 0.029/5 = 0.0058 per hour, still same? No, dr_app/dt is the derivative of the average, which is approximately the average derivative, so for small Δt, it's fine.\n\nThe issue is that at small t, if Δt is large, then for t<Δt, r_app(t) is average from 0 to t, so at t=0, r_app(0) =0, but for t=Δt/2, r_app(t) = average from 0 to t, which is less than r(t) for delta pulse, so the curve is shifted.\n\nBut for age tracking, as long as r_app(t) is monotonic, it can be calibrated.\n\nSo for Slow-FT, since maturation is slow, even Δt=1 hour is fine.\n\nBut to minimize distortion, Δt should be small compared to the time scale of r(t) change.\n\nThe time scale for r(t) change is about 100 hours for Slow-FT, so Δt=1 hour is 1% of the scale, so good.\n\nTherefore, pulse duration should be short, say 10-30 minutes.\n\nNow for expression level optimization.\n\nPromoter strength: weak, medium, or strong.\n\nThis affects the amount of protein expressed.\n\nThe ratio r(t) is independent of expression level, since it's ratio, so in theory, expression level should not affect r(t).\n\nHowever, in practice, there is noise in fluorescence measurement.\n\nThe noise in r(t) comes from noise in B and R measurements.\n\nSuppose we have measured fluorescence B and R with noise σ_B and σ_R.\n\nThen r = R/(B+R), and noise σ_r ≈ |∂r/∂B| σ_B + |∂r/∂R| σ_R, but since B and R are correlated, it's complicated.\n\nTypically, if noise is Poissonian, σ_B ∝ √B, σ_R ∝ √R.\n\nThen for r, the variance can be calculated.\n\nBut from the constraint: \"Typical experimental noise in fluorescence measurements: σ ≈ 0.03\" but this is for fluorescence intensity, not for ratio.\n\nThe σ≈0.03 might be for normalized fluorescence, but let's assume that for a single cell, the measurement noise for B and R is such that the error in r is approximately σ_r ≈ 0.03 / √(B+R) or something? Not sure.\n\nFrom the literature, for flow cytometry, noise in ratio can be estimated.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume that the noise in r is σ_r = k / √(B+R) where k is constant, and B+R is the total fluorescence.\n\nThen to reduce σ_r, we need high B+R, so high expression level.\n\nBut high expression level might have other issues, like resource competition, crowding, or affecting cell health.\n\nBut for timer function, since r(t) is independent of level, we want high expression to reduce noise.\n\nSo strong promoter is better.\n\nBut there might be saturation effects in maturation or detection, but from the FT properties, maturation is intrinsic, so should not be affected by expression level.\n\nTherefore, for best signal-to-noise, use strong promoter.\n\nNow, quantitatively, if noise σ_r ≈ 0.03 / √(B+R) where B+R is in some units, but since we don't have absolute values, we can assume that with weak promoter, B+R is low, so σ_r is high, with strong promoter, B+R is high, so σ_r is low.\n\nFor example, if with weak promoter, B+R = 100 units, σ_r ≈ 0.03 / √100 = 0.003, which is small, but 0.03 might be the relative noise? Let's see the constraint: \"Typical experimental noise in fluorescence measurements: σ ≈ 0.03\" – this likely means that for fluorescence intensity, the coefficient of variation is 0.03, so for B, σ_B / B ≈ 0.03, similarly for R.\n\nThen for r = R/(B+R), the error propagation.\n\nIf B and R are independent, then variance of r is approximately [ (B σ_R)^2 + (R σ_B)^2 ] / (B+R)^4 * (B+R)^2? Let's compute.\n\nLet S = B+R, then r = R/S.\n\nThen σ_r^2 = (∂r/∂R)^2 σ_R^2 + (∂r/∂B)^2 σ_B^2 = (1/S)^2 σ_R^2 + (-R/S^2)^2 σ_B^2 = (1/S^2) σ_R^2 + (R^2/S^4) σ_B^2\n\nSince σ_B ≈ 0.03 B, σ_R ≈ 0.03 R, then\n\nσ_r^2 = (1/S^2) (0.03 R)^2 + (R^2/S^4) (0.03 B)^2 = (0.0009 / S^2) [ R^2 + (R^2 B^2)/S^2 ] = (0.0009 R^2 / S^2) [ 1 + (B^2)/S^2 ]\n\nBut S = B+R, so B/S and R/S are fractions.\n\nFor example, when r=0.5, B=R, so S=2B, so σ_r^2 = (0.0009 (B)^2 / (4B^2)) [1 + (B^2)/(4B^2)] = (0.0009/4) [1 + 1/4] = 0.000225 * 1.25 = 0.00028125, so σ_r = √0.00028125 ≈ 0.0168\n\nSimilarly, if B and R are small, S is small, σ_r is larger.\n\nBut S is proportional to expression level.\n\nSo if we double expression level, S doubles, but σ_B and σ_R also double since σ_B ∝ B, so σ_B / B constant, so in σ_r^2, since σ_R ∝ R, and S ∝ R, so σ_r^2 ∝ 1/S^2 * R^2 ∝ 1/S^2 * S^2 ∝ constant? Let's see.\n\nFrom above, σ_r^2 = (0.0009 R^2 / S^2) [1 + (B^2)/S^2]\n\nBut R/S = r, B/S = 1-r, so σ_r^2 = 0.0009 r^2 [1 + (1-r)^2] \n\nSo σ_r depends only on r, not on S? That can't be right because if S is small, noise should be large, but here σ_B and σ_R are proportional to B and R, so if B and R are small, σ_B and σ_R are small, but the relative error is constant, so the error in r is independent of expression level? That seems counterintuitive.\n\nIn fluorescence measurements, for photon counting, the noise is Poissonian, so σ_B ∝ √B, not ∝ B.\n\nI think I made a mistake.\n\nIn the constraint, it says \"typical experimental noise in fluorescence measurements: σ ≈ 0.03\" – this likely means that the standard deviation of fluorescence intensity is 0.03 times the mean, so σ_B = 0.03 B, so relative error is 0.03, which implies that the noise is proportional to signal, which is not typical for photon noise but might be for other noise sources.\n\nIn many contexts, for fluorescence microscopy, the noise can be modeled as Gaussian with constant coefficient of variation.\n\nSo if σ_B / B = 0.03, then indeed, for r, σ_r is independent of B and R, as above.\n\nSo from above, σ_r = 0.03 * sqrt( r^2 [1 + (1-r)^2] )? From above, σ_r^2 = 0.0009 r^2 [1 + (1-r)^2] \n\nSo for r=0.5, σ_r = 0.03 * sqrt( 0.25 * (1 + 0.25) ) = 0.03 * sqrt(0.25*1.25) = 0.03 * sqrt(0.3125) = 0.03 * 0.559 = 0.01677\n\nSo about 0.017.\n\nAnd this does not depend on expression level.\n\nSo why would expression level matter? If expression level is too low, then B and R might be close to background noise, but if we have sufficient signal above background, then the noise in r is determined by the relative noise.\n\nBut in practice, if expression is too low, the signal might be lost in autofluorescence, so we need enough expression to overcome background.\n\nBut since the noise σ is given as 0.03 for fluorescence measurements, it might assume that signal is above background.\n\nSo for expression level, since r(t) is independent of level, and noise in r is not affected by level, we can use any promoter strength, but to ensure good signal above background, stronger promoter is better.\n\nAlso, for time-lapse imaging, photobleaching might be an issue, so higher expression might help.\n\nBut no major trade-off, so strong promoter is recommended.\n\nTherefore, for expression level, use strong promoter.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\n- FT type: Slow-FT\n\n- Promoter strategy: Periodic promoter at cell birth\n\n- Pulse duration: Short, e.g., 10-30 minutes\n\n- Expression level: Strong promoter\n\nNow for the output."

              "content": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Design Decisions\n\n#### 1. FT Type Selection\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe goal is to track cell age over 0–100 hours post-division in yeast, with a cell cycle of ~87 minutes (~1.45 hours). The timer function relies on the ratio \\( r(t) = R/(B + R) \\), which should change significantly over the measurement window. Based on the provided FT variants (Fast-FT, Medium-FT, Slow-FT), we evaluate their maturation kinetics adjusted to yeast conditions (30°C, cellular environment).\n\n- **Temperature and Environmental Adjustment:**  \n  - Yeast at 30°C is closer to S2 cells at 25°C than in vitro at 37°C, but S2 data shows ~5–10× longer maturation times due to cellular delays (translation, degradation). However, for intrinsic maturation, in vitro data at 37°C is more reliable for kinetic modeling. Using Q₁₀ ≈ 2.0, maturation times scale by \\( 2^{(\\Delta T/10)} \\). From in vitro 37°C to yeast 30°C, ΔT = -7°C, so times increase by \\( 2^{7/10} \\approx 1.624 \\).\n  - Cellular delays further extend times, but for a pulse expression, intrinsic maturation dominates after synthesis. We use in vitro data with temperature adjustment for consistency.\n\n- **Maturation Times at 30°C (from in vitro 37°C data):**  \n  - Fast-FT: red half-max = 7.1 h × 1.624 ≈ 11.5 h  \n  - Medium-FT: red half-max = 3.9 h × 1.624 ≈ 6.3 h  \n  - Slow-FT: red half-max = 28 h × 1.624 ≈ 45.5 h  \n\n- **Δr Calculation Over 0–100 hours:**  \n  - For a pulse at t=0, \\( r(t) \\) increases from 0 to 1 as proteins mature. We approximate \\( r(t) \\approx 1 - e^{-(\\ln 2) t / t_{\\text{red half}}} \\) for simplicity, lumping intermediate states.\n  - **Fast-FT:** \\( r(t) \\) saturates near 1 by ~11.5 h, so Δr ≈ 1 over 0–100 h, but no discrimination for t > ~12 h.\n  - **Medium-FT:** \\( r(t) \\) saturates by ~6.3 h, so Δr ≈ 1 over 0–100 h, but no discrimination for t > ~6 h.\n  - **Slow-FT:** Using in vitro ratio curves at 37°C (Figure 2f), \\( r(t) \\) increases from ~0 at t=0 to ~0.8 at t=100 h. At 30°C, time scaling gives \\( r(100) \\approx r_{37}(100/1.624) \\approx r_{37}(61.6) \\). From linear interpolation of Figure 2f (r=0.4 at t=30 h, r=0.8 at t=100 h), \\( r_{37}(61.6) \\approx 0.58 \\). Thus, Δr ≈ 0.58 over 0–100 h, providing continuous discrimination.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Slow-FT is optimal because it shows significant Δr over 0–100 hours, enabling age tracking across multiple generations (up to ~69 generations), while Fast-FT and Medium-FT saturate too quickly.\n\n**Quantitative Assessment:**  \n- Baseline: In vitro data at 37°C, adjusted to 30°C with factor 1.624.  \n- Slow-FT: \\( t_{\\text{red half}} \\approx 45.5 \\) h at 30°C, Δr ≈ 0.58 over 0–100 h.  \n- Medium-FT: Δr ≈ 1 but saturates by ~6 h, useful only for early ages.  \n- Fast-FT: Δr ≈ 1 but saturates by ~12 h, limited discrimination.\n\n#### 2. Promoter Strategy\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe timer must reflect cell age from birth, requiring that the protein cohort ages uniformly with the cell.  \n- **Constitutive Promoter:** Continuous expression leads to a steady-state mix of protein ages, resulting in constant \\( r(t) \\) independent of cell age. This fails for age tracking.  \n- **Periodic Promoter:** Expression pulsed at cell birth ensures all proteins are synthesized simultaneously, so \\( r(t) \\) increases monotonically with cell age. This aligns with the timer function.\n\n**Conclusion:** Periodic promoter expressed at cell birth is essential.\n\n**Quantitative Assessment:**  \n- With constitutive expression, steady-state \\( r(t) \\) is constant due to continuous synthesis and degradation. For example, with degradation rate \\( k_D \\approx 0.048 \\, \\text{h}^{-1} \\) (from Slow-FT in HeLa cells) and maturation, \\( r(t) \\) stabilizes, eliminating age dependence.  \n- With periodic expression, \\( r(t) \\) tracks age directly, as demonstrated in pulse-chase experiments (e.g., Tet-Off in HeLa cells).\n\n#### 3. Pulse Optimization\n**Reasoning:**  \nFor periodic expression, pulse duration (width) affects temporal resolution.  \n- **Short Pulse:** Sharp protein cohort ensures \\( r(t) \\) closely reflects age t, maximizing dr/dt and resolution.  \n- **Long Pulse:** Cohort has age spread, causing \\( r(t) \\) to average over ages, reducing resolution and shifting the curve.  \n- **Practical Constraints:** Yeast cell cycle is ~87 minutes, so pulse should be short relative to cycle time to avoid overlap with subsequent generations. Slow-FT maturation (hours) allows short pulses without significant distortion.\n\n**Conclusion:** Pulse duration should be minimized (e.g., 10–30 minutes) for optimal resolution.\n\n**Quantitative Assessment:**  \n- For Slow-FT, \\( dr/dt \\approx 0.0058 \\, \\text{h}^{-1} \\) over 0–100 h.  \n- With pulse width Δt = 0.5 h, the difference \\( r(t) - r(t - \\Delta t) \\approx 0.0029 \\), so \\( dr_{\\text{app}}/dt \\approx 0.0058 \\, \\text{h}^{-1} \\), similar to actual derivative.  \n- Δt = 1 h is only 1% of 100 h scale, causing negligible distortion. Shorter pulses (e.g., 10 minutes) are even better.\n\n#### 4. Expression Level Optimization\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe ratio \\( r(t) \\) is independent of expression level, but noise in fluorescence measurements affects precision.  \n- **Noise Analysis:** Given typical noise σ ≈ 0.03 per fluorescence measurement (coefficient of variation), error in \\( r(t) \\) is derived from error propagation:  \n  \\( \\sigma_r^2 \\approx (0.03)^2 \\left[ r^2 + (1-r)^2 \\right] \\).  \n  For r=0.5, σ_r ≈ 0.017, which is acceptable and independent of expression level.  \n- **Signal-to-Noise:** Higher expression reduces relative impact of background autofluorescence and photobleaching, ensuring reliable detection. Low expression may risk signal loss.\n\n**Conclusion:** Strong promoter is preferred to maximize signal above background without affecting \\( r(t) \\).\n\n**Quantitative Assessment:**  \n- σ_r ≈ 0.017 at r=0.5, which is small compared to Δr ≈ 0.58 for Slow-FT.  \n- With strong promoter, B + R is high, minimizing background effects. For example, doubling expression does not change σ_r but improves signal quality.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- **FT Type:** Slow-FT  \n- **Promoter Strategy:** Periodic promoter activated at cell birth  \n- **Pulse Duration:** 10–30 minutes  \n- **Expression Level:** Strong promoter  \n\n### Quantitative Summary Table\n| Parameter | Fast-FT | Medium-FT | Slow-FT |\n|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|\n| \\( t_{\\text{red half}} \\) at 30°C | ~11.5 h | ~6.3 h | ~45.5 h |\n| Δr over 0–100 h | ~1 (saturates early) | ~1 (saturates early) | ~0.58 |\n| Age discrimination | Limited to <12 h | Limited to <6 h | Up to 100 h |\n| **Promoter Strategy** | Periodic | Periodic | Periodic |\n| **Pulse Duration** | 10–30 min | 10–30 min | 10–30 min |\n| **Expression Level** | Strong | Strong | Strong |\n\n### Potential Limitations and Caveats\n- **Cellular Variability:** Maturation times may vary due to cellular conditions (e.g., pH, crowding). Slow-FT's pH stability (ratio change <8% from pH 5.4–7.4) is beneficial for yeast (pH 6.0–6.5).\n- **Degradation Effects:** Protein degradation (half-life ~14–24 h) may slightly flatten \\( r(t) \\) over time, but Slow-FT's slow maturation minimizes this impact.\n- **Lineage Tracking:** Daughter cells inherit immature proteins from mothers, which could blur age signals. Using birth-specific expression minimizes this.\n- **Experimental Noise:** σ_r ≈ 0.017 is acceptable for discerning age-dependent changes with Slow-FT's Δr ≈ 0.58.\n- **Temperature Sensitivity:** Maturation rates are temperature-dependent; maintain consistent 30°C growth conditions."

The protein expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1\n\n(for screening of Fast-FT) or 4 h (for screening of Medium-FT and Slow-FT). Then Fast-FT and\n\nMedium-FT libraries were screened using MoFlo (Dako) fluorescence activated cell sorter\n\n(FACS). In the case of Slow-FT library, the cells were pelletted down, resuspended in RM\n\nmedium supplemented with glucose, and FACS sorted 20 h later. For FACS sorting, the bacteria\n\nwere washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM\n\nNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and then diluted with PBS to optical density of 0.02\n\nat 600 nm. MoFlo cell sorter was equipped with Krypton, Argon, and Argon-Krypton mixed-gas\n\nlasers. For detection of the blue (450/65 nm filter), green (530/40 nm filter) and red (580 nm\n\nlongpass filter) fluorescence emissions, 407, 488 and 568 nm laser lines were used, respectively.\n\nTypically about 10 sizes of each library were screened. The collected brightest blue/non\ngreen/non-red bacterial cells were rescued in rich Super Optimal broth with Catabolite repression\n\n(SOC) medium at 37[0]C for several hours, and then were spread on 0.45 µm nitrocellulose\n\nmembranes placed on Petri dishes with Luria-Bertani medium (LB)/Ampicillin and incubated for\n\novernight at 37[0]C. Next morning the membranes were placed on Rich Medium (RM)/Ampicillin\n\nPetri dishes with 0.2% arabinose to induce protein expression. After incubation for 1 h (Fast-FT)\n\nor 4 h (Medium-FT) at 37[0]C, the brightest blue/non-green/non-red colonies were marked off\n\nusing Leica MZ16F fluorescence stereomicroscope equipped with custom blue (390/40 nm\n\nexciter, 460/40 nm emitter), green (480/40 nm exciter, 530/40 nm emitter), and red (570/30 nm\n\nexciter, 615/40 nm emitter) filter sets (Chroma). In the case of Slow-FT, additional 20 h of\n\nprotein maturation time were required to select the brightest blue/non-green/dim-red colonies. 1\n\nh (Fast-FT) or 4 h (Medium-FT and Slow-FT) after the start of the expression, the membranes\n\nwere placed on Petri dishes with RM/Ampicillin/0.2% glucose to repress the protein production.\n\nThen, 24 h (Fast-FT or Medium-FT) or 48 h (Slow-FT) later, the brightest red/non-blue/non\ngreen colonies among the previously marked clones were selected.\n\n**Protein purification.** To purify recombinant proteins, LMG194 cells grown overnight were\n\ndiluted to optical density 1.0 at 600 nm, and 0.2% arabinose was added for induction of protein\n\n===== Page 12 =====\n\nexpression. The bacterial cultures were then grown at 37[0]C in 50 ml tubes filled to the brim and\ntightly sealed to restrict oxygen supply. After 1 h, the cultures were pelleted down in the same\ntightly closed tubes. After opening the tubes, the proteins were purified using B-Per reagent\n(Pierce) and Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) within 15 min with all procedures and buffers at 4[0]C.\n\n**Insect and mammalian plasmid construction.** To make pRmHa-3-FTs plasmids, the PCR\namplified EcoRI-BamHI fragments encoding FTs were inserted into pRmHa-3 vector [21]. To\ngenerate LAMP-2A-FTs fusion proteins, the PCR-amplified Xhol-Agel fragments encoding FTs\nwere swapped with TSapphire-GFP in the pcDNA-3.1-LAMP-2A-TSapphire-GFP vector (gift of\nDr. D.Reeves). To make pTRE-FTs or pTRE-LAMP-2A-FTs plasmids, the PCR amplified\n_EcoRI-Xbal fragments encoding either FTs or LAMP-2A-FTs fusion proteins, respectively, were_\ninserted into pTRE vector (Clontech).\n\n**Transfection. Transfection of Drosophila S2 cells and all mammalian cells was carried out with**\nthe Effectene reagent (Qiagen). For microscopy imaging, HeLa, Cos-1, NIH3T3 or HeLa Tet-Off\ncells were plated on 25 mm glass coverslips in Dulbecco modified essential medium (DMEM)\n(Invitrogen) supplied with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma). S2 cells were cultured in\nSchnieder’s medium (Gibco) supplied with L-glutamine and 10% FBS (Sigma) at 25[0]C. To\nestablish stable pre-clonal cell cultures, pRmHa-3-FTs plasmids were co-transfected with\npCoBlast vector (Invitrogen) and selected with 25 µg/ml of blasticidin for 2 weeks.\n\n**Staining of cellular compartments in mammalian cells.** For staining of early and recycling\nendosomes with transferrin-Alexa 488, cells were washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM\nwithout FBS for 30 min at 37[0]C. After adding 50 µg/ml of transferrin-Alexa 488, cells were\nincubated at 4[0]C for 15 min before rinsing with PBS and further incubation in DMEM supplied\nwith 10% FBS for the next 20 min at 37[0]C. For staining of late endosomes and lysosomes, cells\nwere incubated with 100 nM of Lysotracker Green for 30 min at 37[0]C before imaging. For\nvisualization of Golgi network, HeLa Tet-Off cells were co-transfected with pTRE-LAMP-2AMedium-FT and pGalT-EYFP using 10:1 plasmid ratio.\n\n===== Page 13 =====\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Qasba, P.K., Ramakrishnan, B. & Boeggeman, E.

However, until recently, most synthetic\nbiology systems have focused on bacteria. While there is a wealth of resources and literature\nabout the biology of yeast, it can be daunting to navigate and extract the tools needed for\nengineering applications. Here we present a versatile engineering platform for yeast, which\ncontains both a rapid, modular assembly method and a basic set of characterized parts. This\nplatform provides a framework in which to create new designs, as well as data on promoters,\nterminators, degradation tags, and copy number to inform those designs. Additionally, we\ndescribe genome-editing tools for making modifications directly to the yeast chromosomes,\nwhich we find preferable to plasmids due to reduced variability in expression.

Unfortunately, the potential\npower of the cell also brings with it a level of complexity that\nmakes engineering biological systems extremely difficult.\nSynthetic biologists have sought ways to abstract the layers of\ncomplexity into components with predictable interactions,\nmaking it more feasible to undertake large engineering projects.\nDespite these efforts, the inner workings of the cell continue to\nelude understanding, and while certain elements can be highly\npredictable, the system behavior as a whole is difficult to\nanticipate. These challenges have led to an additional, and\nequally important, aspect to synthetic biology: rapid prototyp-\ning.1−4 Because manipulations to the cell often lead to\nunexpected results, progress is best made by rapidly iterating\nthrough highly parallelized experiments to explore a wide\nparameter space.5,6 It is the combination of these two\nprinciplespredictable parts and rapid prototypingthat\ngive synthetic biologists the ability to approach difficult\nproblems in energy,7,8 agriculture,9 and human health.10−12\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is growing in popularity as a chassis for\nsynthetic biology due to its powerful genetic tools,13−15\nextensively studied biology,16−19 and long history of industrial\napplications.20−22 In this work, we present a synthetic biology\ntoolkit for engineering yeast that simplifies and accelerates\nexperimentation in this important model organism.\nAbstraction is a fundamental principle in any engineering\ndiscipline. It allows an engineer to focus on an individual\ncomponent with the assurance that it will interface correctly\nwith other components, both existing and future. When applied\nto synthetic biology, abstraction typically refers to the level of\ncomplexity of the DNA that is being built or introduced into\ncells. “Parts” are often thought of as one of the most basic DNA\nsequence elements that can be assigned a function. For\nexample, a coding sequence, a transcriptional terminator, and\nan origin of replication could all be described as parts. Although\nthese parts can be broken down furtherthey contain, among\nother things, a start and stop codon, a hairpin, and a protein\nbinding site, respectivelythe benefit of abstraction is the\nability to ignore those lower level details and work with a part\nbased solely on its reported function.

The lag between having a DNA design and actually obtaining the physical DNA is far too long to support a robust prototyping workflow. The solution that many groups have developed is standardization of cloning.\\(^{27-33}\\) For example, the BioBrick standard (and its relatives) defines a set of restriction enzymes sites that are used to flank each part in a vector.\\(^{27,30}\\) When those restriction enzymes are used to join two parts, the junction contains an assembly “scar”, and the resulting plasmid reconstitutes the sites external to the newly combined parts (an idempotent operation). This enables an endless number of cycles of pairwise assembly. More recently, Golden Gate assembly based methods have increased in popularity due to the added flexibility provided by the use of Type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside their recognition sequence and provide unique cohesive ends to enable directional, multi-insert, one-pot cloning.\\(^{33}\\) One example is the MoClo (modular cloning) system, which categorizes parts as “types” based on their function and location in a completed device (_e.g.,_ promoter types or coding sequence types) and designates particular overhangs that flank each type, allowing all parts of a particular type to be interchangeable.\\(^{32}\\) In this work, we adapted the MoClo strategy specifically to build yeast expression devices. The major advantage of using a standardized system such as MoClo is that once parts are constructed, they are immediately available for incorporation into devices and no longer require synthesis of oligonucleotides, PCR amplification and purification, or verification by sequencing. This allows us to construct from parts, a plasmid carrying multiple gene expression devices in as little as 2 days.\n\n■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nDefinition of an Assembly Standard for Yeast. Our standard for assembling DNA for expression in yeast is a bottom-up hierarchical approach to DNA construction (Figure 1). A description of the assembly scheme, part types, and overhang sequences are discussed briefly here and in more detail in the Supporting Information. For brevity, Golden Gate assemblies using either Baal or BsmBI are referred to as “Baal assembly” and “BsmBI assembly”.\n\nOur workflow for assembling complex plasmids for expressing multiple genes in yeast has multiple steps that correspond to our abstraction layers. First, source DNA is obtained through PCR, synthesis or another user-preferred method. That source DNA is “domesticated” via BsmBI assembly into a universal entry vector, resulting in a “part” plasmid. Part plasmids come in different Types, numbered 1 through 8 (with some optional subtypes). Each part Type is defined by the sequences of the upstream and downstream flanking overhangs generated when digested by Baal. All parts of a particular Type are interchangeable, which lends the system well to combinatorial experiments. Part plasmids are joined in a Baal assembly to form a “cassette” plasmid that, in most cases, is used to express a single gene in yeast (a transcriptional unit, TU, comprised of a promoter, coding sequence, and terminator). These cassettes can optionally be joined in a final BsmBI assembly to form “multi-gene” plasmids that, as the name suggests, are used to simultaneously express multiple genes. The multigene assembly is enabled by the use of Assembly Connectors (Type 1 and 5) that, in similar fashion to each part plasmid’s unique Baal overhangs, contain unique BsmBI overhangs that flank each cassette. At each round of assembly, the antibiotic selection is changed to minimize background (typically, chloramphenicol → ampicillin → kanamycin). Using this workflow, we can construct a multigene plasmid from PCR templates in only 3 days. This construction time is typically reduced to only 2 days, since, in most cases, the final multigene plasmids are built from existing parts.\n\nThere are many benefits to the standard we defined, which should prove useful to synthetic biologists with a wide range of needs. First, the cloning protocols are extremely simple, requiring no PCR amplification or purification steps after the initial part creation. Second, the standardized Golden Gate assemblies are highly robust. It was previously shown that for a 10-part assembly with an optimized set of overhangs, 97% of isolated transformations contained a correctly assembled\n\nA.

Note that the eight primary part Types can be further divided into subtypes (\\( e.g., 3a/3b \\)), or combined to make composite types (\\( eg, 234 \\)). Each Type has a unique upstream and downstream overhang pair, and a complete cassette can be assembled when a complete path can be drawn from left to right (\\( 1\\) to \\( 8 \\)). For example, the preassembled integration vector is assembled from ConLS’ (\\( 1 \\)), GFP dropout (\\( 234 \\)), ConRE’ (\\( 5 \\)), URA3 (\\( 6 \\)), URA3 3’ Homology (\\( 7 \\)), KanR-CoIE1 (\\( 8a \\)), and URA3 5’ Homology (\\( 8b \\)). A transcriptional unit (promoter, coding sequence, terminator) can be assembled into this vector, replacing the Baal-flanked GFP dropout. A set of cassettes can also be assembled into this vector, due to the special Assembly Connectors ConLS’ and ConRE’ that have the BsmBI recognition sites in the reverse orientation (Supporting Information). The part plasmid entry vector is used for constructing new parts. A table of plasmid names, parts, and Types is included in Supporting Table S1.\n\nplasmid.\\(^{34}\\) We observed comparable efficiencies in this work and screened only one transformation for almost all plasmid assemblies described here. Because PCR- and oligonucleotide-derived point mutations cannot occur after the construction of part plasmids, we do not typically sequence downstream assemblies and instead use simple restriction mapping to verify size. Third, our workflow supports a simple method for chromosomal integration in which plasmids designed for integration can be transformed directly after being linearized via a Notl digestion.\\(^{35}\\) Fourth, our design specification includes unique restriction enzyme sites that make cassettes both BioBrick- and BglBrick-compatible, and multigene plasmids BioBrick-compatible. While a variety of restriction sites (BamHI, BbsI, BglII, BsaI, BsmBI, EcoRI, Notl, PstI, Spel, XbaI, and Xhol) have been removed from all parts in the toolkit for increased flexibility, only BsaI, BsmBI, and Notl must be removed from new parts to conform to the complete assembly scheme described here. Finally, the Assembly Connectors, in addition to harboring BsmBI sites, can also act as homology sequences for recombination-based cloning, such as sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC),\\(^{36}\\) Gibson assembly,\\(^{37,38}\\) ligase cycling reaction (LCR),\\(^{39}\\) or yeast in vivo assembly,\\(^{40}\\) if those methods are preferred.\n\n**A Toolkit of Yeast Parts.** Although an assembly standard has some inherent value, its utility is determined in large part by the availability of parts.

(C) Galactose induction of pGAL1 increases expression from background levels up to the highest expressing constitutive promoter, pTDH3. All solid line data were collected from a Agal2 strain. The dashed line shows a much more sensitive response to galactose induction in a wild type strain. Points represent the median value of four biological replicates, and error bars show the range.\n\ncollection of 96 parts compatible with this standard for efficiently engineering yeast strains (Figure 2 and Supporting Table S1). This starter collection contains an assortment of promoters, terminators, fluorescent proteins, peptide tags, selectable markers, and origins of replication, as well as a part entry vector into which new parts can be cloned. Additionally, we have included sequences targeting chromosomal loci for integration, and genome-editing tools for introducing double-strand breaks to stimulate homologous recombination. Finally, rather than provide a large array of different vectors, the assembly standard enables construction of custom vectors directly from parts in the toolkit, and one such vector is included as an example (Supporting Information).\n\nCharacterization of Promoters. We have characterized 19 constitutive promoters, two mating-type-specific promoters, and two inducible promoters, all cloned from the yeast genome (although synthetic promoters\\(^{4-7}\\) could easily be ported into the system as well). The promoters were selected to span a wide range of transcriptional strengths while minimizing variability between growth conditions.\\(^{43}\\) In general, they constitute the 700 bp directly upstream of the native start codon, although in some cases where another ORF was less than 700 bp away, we cloned only the intergenic noncoding region. To examine the strength of each promoter, we cloned it upstream of a fluorescent reporter (mRuby2, Venus, and mTurguoise2) and measured bulk fluorescence on a plate reader.\n\nIt was previously shown that the strength of constitutive promoters cloned from the yeast genome was largely independent of the downstream coding sequence,\\(^{44}\\) an important distinction between controlling expression in bacteria and yeast. This held true for the 19 constitutive promoters characterized in this work (which include some overlap with Lee et al., 2013)\\(^{44}\\) (Figure 3A and Supporting Figure S1). The promoters span a range of up to 3 orders of magnitude, and there are also some promoters that have very similar expression strengths, allowing them to be interchanged so as to reduce the risk of undesired homologous recombination in multigene plasmids due to repeated sequences. Although we only tested these promoters in one type of media, the majority of native yeast promoters have been shown to maintain their relative expression strengths in different growth conditions, although the absolute strengths may change.\\(^{45}\\)\n\nIt is sometimes useful to have genes under dynamic control, and for this we provide two tools: mating-type-specific and inducible promoters. We tested pMFA1 and pMFa2 and found that they have very close to background levels of fluorescence\n\n978\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500566v\nACS Synth. Biol. 2015, 4, 975–986\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology\n\nFigure 4. Characterization of terminators. Six terminators were cloned behind three fluorescent proteins, each driven by three promoters. The relative expression levels for this set of terminators are largely independent of the coding sequence and the promoter. The height of the bars represents the median value of four biological replicates, and the error bars show the range.\n\nin both the opposite mating-type haploid and diploid strains and a 6- to 10-fold induction in the appropriate haploid (Figure 3B). We also tested pGAL1 in varying concentrations of galactose and observed a 100-fold induction (Figure 3C). Although the promoter can be used in wild-type strains, the response is very sensitive to low concentrations of galactose; a strain with the GAL2 transporter knocked out should be used for more graded control overexpression.\\(^{46}\\) Finally, we tested pCUP1 in varying concentrations of copper(II) sulfate (CuSO\\(_4\\)) and observed a 55-fold induction (Supporting Figure S2). This promoter exhibits leaky expression under basal conditions, with approximately 7-fold fluorescence over background when CuSO\\(_4\\) is not added to the media. This may be due in part to the CuSO\\(_4\\) that is present at 250 nM in the yeast nitrogen base commonly used to make defined media.\n\nCharacterization of Terminators. The impact of different transcriptional terminators on gene expression can vary considerably, and could provide a secondary mode of control to complement the promoters. However, for simplicity, we opted in this toolkit to provide terminators that yielded approximately the same expression output. Using expression data from the whole yeast genome,\\(^{43}\\) we selected six of the most highly expressed genes and cloned the 225 bp immediately downstream of the stop codon. We assembled these terminators with each of our three fluorescent reporters and each using three promoters. The largest difference in expression we observed between terminators for a given promoter and fluorescent protein was 36-fold (Figure 4). In general, the fold-changes produced by different promoters were greater than those effected by the terminators, but this was not always the case. If applications are sensitive to small fold-changes of expression, we advise characterizing individual promoter-terminator pairs to ensure that the desired levels of expression are obtained.\n\nProtein Degradation Tags. In addition to controlling transcript levels, protein levels can be tuned by fusing degradation tags to the N-terminus. We have included three such tags of varying strengths, Ubi-M (weak), Ubi-Y (medium), and Ubi-R (strong), which can be used to adjust the rate of protein turnover.\\(^{47}\\) We fused these tags to the N-terminus of mRuby2, and expressed them using a strong, moderate, and weak promoter, pTDH3, pRPL18B, and pREV1, respectively. The strong degradation tag (Ubi-R) resulted in no detectable fluorescence at any expression level, while the medium strength degradation tag (Ubi-Y) resulted in detectable levels of fluorescence at only the highest expression level (Figure 5).\n\nCopy Number, Gene Expression, and Single-Cell Variability. When engineering yeast strains expressing multiple heterologous proteins, it is important to consider the relative expression of those proteins. As described above, protein levels can be controlled by changing promoters, terminators, or degradation rates. However, another important consideration is the copy number of the gene(s). Typically, one of three systems is used to express genes in yeast: single-copy integrations into the chromosome, low-copy CEN6/ARS4 plasmids, and high-copy 2micron plasmids. One could easily assume that the differences in copy number simply titrate gene expression accordingly, but we observed that there are subtle, but important, effects that could influence the decision to use one system over another.\n\nWe cloned cassettes expressing either mRuby2 or Venus under strong, moderate, and weak promoters (pTDH3, pRPL18B, and pREV1, respectively). Versions of these cassettes were made for each of the three copy numbers. Finally, each of the nine possible combinations of the three promoters and two genes were either assembled in tandem onto a single chromosomal locus/plasmid or kept separate in two loci/plasmids. We measured bulk fluorescence of both fluorescent proteins to compare protein expression levels of the cell populations at the three copy-numbers (Figure 6 and Supporting Figure S3).\n\nIn the chromosomally integrated strains, the different promoter combinations fill out the points of a regular grid, as expected. In the low-copy CEN6/ARS4 plasmid system, the absolute fluorescence is generally higher compared to the\n\nFigure 5. Protein degradation tags. Three N-terminal degradation tags were fused to mRuby2 and expressed using three different promoters. Steady-state fluorescence levels are dependent on the difference between the strength of the promoter and the strength of the degradation tag. The height of the bars represents the median value of six biological replicates, and the error bars show the range.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500906\n979 ACS Synth.

Three promoters \\( pTDH3, pRPL18B, and pREV1 \\) drive two fluorescent proteins (mRuby2 and Venus) in all nine possible combinations. These nine combinations are integrated into the chromosome (blue), expressed from a low-copy plasmid (green), and expressed from a high-copy plasmid (red). The translucent, shaded boxes show the range of expression spanned by each respective copy number. For lower strength promoters, increasing copy number gives higher fluorescence; but for the strongest promoter, there is a much smaller difference between the low- and high-copy plasmids. Each gene is integrated in a separate locus or expressed from a separate plasmid. The horizontal and vertical bars represent the range of four biological replicates, and the intersection represents the median value.\n\nchromosome, again, as expected. Interestingly, the range between the highest and lowest expression is actually slightly greater in the CENG/ARS4 plasmid system. Compared to low-copy plasmids, the high-copy 2micron plasmids showed considerably more irregular expression patterns. In the two-plasmid, 2micron system, the grid is preserved, but compressed at higher expression levels, suggesting that some expression machinery in the cell is limiting and that having more copies of the DNA has little effect on increasing expression; i.e., the average fluorescence of cells with the strongest promoter is similar between low- and high-copy plasmids. In the single-plasmid, 2micron system, not only is the grid compressed, but also it appears that high expression of one gene seems to reduce the expression of the second gene (Supporting Figure S3). On the basis of flow cytometry, there appears to be a bimodal distribution for some of these populations (Figure 7C, e.g., \\( pTDH3-mRuby2/pRPL18B-Venus \\)), which is consistent with previous studies comparing the distribution of expression in 2micron and chromosomally integrated systems.\\(^{48}\\) Interestingly, this effect is not nearly as pronounced in the chromosome or on the low-copy plasmid. It is unclear why this would be specific to the high-copy plasmid. On the basis of these data, we believe that use of high-copy 2micron plasmids should generally be avoided, since the highest expression levels accessible by them are very nearly accessible by low-copy CENG/ARS4 plasmids, and low-copy plasmids give greater access to lower expression, and in general have less erratic expression patterns.\n\nAnother parameter we examined was cell-to-cell variability in the relative expression of two genes. While it has been shown that strains expressing fluorescent proteins from chromosomally integrated genes display much tighter distributions compared to those expressing from 2micron plasmids,\\(^{48}\\) we were curious about any additional effects of propagating one versus multiple plasmids. We took the same cultures used to measure bulk fluorescence and ran them on a flow cytometer to measure single-cell fluorescence of the two fluorescent proteins (Figure 7). As expected, the single-cell measurements revealed that the variability in fluorescence increased considerably when moving from the chromosome to either a low-copy or high-copy plasmid, indicating that the precise copy number of these plasmids is not tightly regulated. When expressed from a single locus/plasmid, the expression of the two fluorescent proteins\n\nFigure 7. Effect of copy number on single-cell gene expression. The same strains expressing mRuby2 and Venus that measured for bulk fluorescence in Figure 6 and Supporting Figure S3 were run on a flow cytometer: chromosomally integrated in a single locus (A) or two loci (D); on a single (B) or two (E) low-copy plasmids; on a single (C) or two (F) high-copy plasmids. As copy number increased, the variability of expression also increased. For all single-locus strains, the expression of the two fluorescent proteins was well correlated, suggesting that copy number is the main contributor to variation in expression. When expressed from two plasmids, correlation between fluorescent proteins is lost, suggesting that the copy number of each plasmid is independent of the other. Fluorescence in each channel was normalized for cell size by dividing by forward-scatter. Dot plots for each sample represent 5000–10000 events.\n\n980\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500366v\nACS Synth. Biol. 2015, 4, 975–986\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology Research Article\n\nwas well correlated, as evidenced by the distribution of each strain along the diagonal. This result suggests that DNA copy number is the primary source of added variation in plasmid-based expression systems, a model which is further supported by the data from two loci/plasmids. Strains expressing mRuby2 and Venus from two separate loci in the chromosome showed distributions that are nearly identical to the single locus, chromosomal strains. In contrast, the low-copy and high-copy plasmids lose their tight correlation between the two fluorescent proteins when the two genes are expressed from separate plasmids. Thus, not only is the copy number of a plasmid highly variable, the relative copy numbers of two plasmids in the same cell are not well correlated. Therefore, we would recommend that genes be integrated into the chromosome whenever possible. If, however, higher expression than can be attained from the chromosome is required, use of a low-copy plasmid is preferred, and all genes should be expressed from the same plasmid rather than split onto multiple plasmids. Accordingly, the assembly standard we provide here accommodates the facile assembly of up to six genes on a single plasmid or in a single chromosomal locus, with more possible if additional Assembly Connectors are designed.\n\nHigh-Efficiency Integrations into the Chromosome. Yeast is well suited to chromosomal modification due to its efficient homologous recombination machinery. This allows for site-specific integration of DNA into the chromosome by simply transforming linear DNA flanked by sequences homologous to the target locus. However, compared to plasmid transformation, integrations usually result in almost an order of magnitude reduction in colony counts, which is one reason why the use of plasmids is often preferred. Given the desire for chromosomal integrations described earlier, it is evident that a higher efficiency method for integrating into the chromosome is necessary, particularly when working with large libraries. Fortunately, it was previously shown that transformation efficiency could be dramatically improved by using a homing endonuclease to generate a double-strand break in the chromosome and stimulate recombination.\\(^{49}\\) More recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) system has been used for similar purposes.\\(^{50-52}\\) We tested both systems to directly compare their effects on chromosomal library construction.\n\nFirst, we prepared an experimental strain by integrating a \"landing pad\" using conventional homologous recombination of linear DNA (Supporting Figure S4A). This landing pad contained an I-Scel recognition site; the I-Scel recognition site conveniently contains an NGG protospaer adjacent motif (PAM) close to the I-Scel cutting site, and we added an extra 10 bp upstream of the site to create a 20 bp targeting sequence for a single guide RNA (sgRNA); we also included a partial URA3 coding sequence and terminated that by itself is nonfunctional.\n\nNext, we designed the repair DNA we were integrating to contain a Venus-expressing cassette and a HIS3-expressing cassette, flanked by homology to the sequence upstream of the landing pad and to the partial URA3 marker. Thus, when the DNA integrated successfully, the cells would be prototrophic for histidine and uracil, and they would be fluorescent. If the DNA integrated off-target, the cells would be prototrophic for histidine and fluorescent, but they would remain auxotrophic for uracil, allowing us to measure the rate of off-target integration by selecting on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA).\n\nFinally, we compared the efficiency of integration when the repair DNA was transformed unassisted, with a transient \"cutter\" plasmid (we did not select for it) expressing Cas9 and an sgRNA, or with a transient cutter plasmid expressing I-Scel. As a control for cell competency, we transformed a circular version of the repair DNA that also contained an origin of replication (Figure 8 and Supporting Figure S4B). Compared to the plasmid transformation, unassisted integration gave approximately 6-fold fewer colonies. When a CRISPR/Cas9 cutter plasmid was cotransformed, there was a 2-fold increase in colony count over unassisted integration; when an I-Scel cutter plasmid was cotransformed, there was an additional 2.5-fold increase (5-fold compared to unassisted). We were able to further improve the efficiency for both the Cas9 and I-Scel systems by linearizing (with a restriction digest) the cutter plasmid prior to transformation. Doing so brought the efficiency of Cas9-assisted integration to match that of plasmid transformation. Incredibly, the linearized I-Scel-expressing DNA actually increased integration efficiency to 1.8-fold over the rate of plasmid transformation. We measured the rate of off-target integration for this most efficient method (linearized I-Scel) and found that only 0.02% of transformants were 5-FOA resistant, and therefore had integrated the repair DNA improperly. By measuring Venus fluorescence, we found that 0.14% of transformants contained multiple integrations. It is unclear why linearizing the cutter plasmid increases the transformation efficiency, but one possibility is that linear DNA enters the cell and/or nucleus more efficiently than circular plasmids. Regardless, the ease with which sequences\n\nFigure 8: High-efficiency integration into the chromosome. Integration of linear DNA into the chromosome by homologous recombination yields 6-fold fewer colonies (compare shaded bars). Adding in a Cas9 or I-Scel improves transformation efficiency by 2-fold and 5-fold, respectively (compare white bars to unassisted integration). Linearizing the Cas9 or I-Scel expression plasmid prior to transformation further improves transformation efficiency to match plasmid transformation efficiency or exceed it by 1.8-fold, respectively (compare striped bars to plasmid transformation). Colony counts are normalized to the number of colonies from the plasmid transformation for each replicate. The height of the bars represents the mean value of three biological replicates, and the error bars show the standard error of the mean.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10500906\n981 ACS Synth.

Although the high-efficiency integration method described above is very powerful for integrating sequences into the chromosome, it requires a selectable marker be present in the integrated DNA. There are some cases where this requirement is undesirable, such as knocking out multiple genes in a single strain. In this case, a unique marker is needed for each locus; markers must be introduced and then removed for each sequential knockout; or complex mating and screening strategies have to be used to collect all the mutants in a single strain. To avoid these tedious procedures, we adapted the recently described CRISPRm method for making multiple genome edits simultaneously.\\(^{51}\\)\n\nFirst, we designed two sgRNAs to target each of four genes—LEU2, HIS3, MET15, and TRP1—and repair DNAs (PCR products with 60 bp of homology flanking a 20 bp barcode, see Supporting Figure SSA, Supporting Table S2, and Supporting Table S3) that target those loci and introduce a premature stop codon. We assembled each sgRNA onto a CENG/AR54 plasmid containing a Cas9 expression cassette with a UR43 marker (Supporting Figure SSB). We then transformed each plasmid with or without its cognate repair DNA and selected for transformations on synthetic media lacking uracil (Figure 9A and 9B, and Supporting Figure SSC). For seven out of eight guides, the transformations with repair DNA had over 100-fold more colonies than those without repair DNA. This large difference in colony yields suggests that when Cas9 successfully targets a locus in the genome, the double-strand break it introduces is toxic to the cell; when a repair DNA is present, it removes the target and abolishes the toxicity caused by Cas9. Thus, selecting for the Cas9 plasmid indirectly selects for repairs to the genome at the targeted locus. It should be noted that both here and elsewhere,\\(^{51,52}\\) it has been shown that the effectiveness of sgRNAs at targeting is variable, and so we recommend that multiple guides be tested until more robust design rules have been determined.\n\nNext, to test multiplexed knockouts, we assembled guides in tandem on a single plasmid with Cas9, targeting one, two, three, or all four loci at once. The standardization and modularity of our assembly scheme made the construction of these multitargeting plasmids straightforward. We transformed these plasmids, again, with or without their cognate repair DNAs, and selected on synthetic media lacking uracil. We picked 40 colonies into different dropout media to determine the fraction of transformants that had the correct phenotype (auxotrophy). Consistent with results from Ryan et al.,\\(^{51}\\) as the number of simultaneous targets increased, the fraction of correct transformants decreased, but it was still possible to disrupt all four targets at once with ~20% efficiency (Figure 9C). One possible cause of this decrease in efficiency could be recombination within the Cas9 plasmid that excises one or more guides, which could be minimized by using different promoters for each guide, but this has not been tested. Although the intention here is loss-of-function disruptions, only assaying for phenotype does not demonstrate the rate of correct repair DNA incorporation, as a nonhomologous end joining could also result in a disruption. To assay this, we screened six (three from each replicate) phenotypically correct colonies for each transformation by colony PCR. For the single, double, and triple knockouts, all six colonies were correct, and for the quadruple knockout, four out of six were correct.\n\nIn addition to disrupting genes, this same strategy could be used to integrate large constructs in a markerless fashion or to introduce single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In cases where SNPs do not completely disrupt sgRNA targeting, two rounds of editing can be performed. The first round sgRNA should target the endogenous sequence, and the repair DNA should destroy the target and/or PAM by introducing a temporary, orthogonal sequence. The second round sgRNA should target the newly introduced sequence, and the repair DNA should reintroduce the endogenous sequence with the desired SNP. Although the same could be accomplished using a counterselectable marker such as UR43, using CRISPRm allows for multiple modifications to be made at once.\n\nSummary. We have described a methodology and an accompanying toolkit of essential parts for engineering yeast. This MoClo-derived assembly standard supports the rapid cloning of multigene expression devices. We characterized a set of promoters and terminators, which are by no means exhaustive or perfect, but nonetheless diverse, in order to support the construction of multigene plasmids with minimal risk of unwanted homologous recombination. As a distinct method of controlling protein concentration, degradation tags are also characterized. Additionally, we have illustrated an important difference between using plasmids and chromosomal integrations and encourage expression from the chromosome whenever possible. To facilitate this, our system is designed to\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{target} & \\text{logit targeted} & \\text{LEU2} & \\text{LEU2, HIS3} & \\text{LEU2, HIS3, MET15} & \\text{LEU2, HIS3, MET15, TRP1} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{fraction correct phenotype} & 3940 & 3840 & 3640 & 2640 & 2340 & 3040 & 1140 & 640 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{number of transformants} & 110,000 & 90,000 & 8,000 & 3,000 & 1,200 & 575 & 212 & 70 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{fraction of correct phenotype with correct genotype} & 798 & 779 & 107 & 108 & 250 & 110 & 61 & 53 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{total exposure} & 33 & 33 & 33 & 33 & 33 & 33 & 23 & 23 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nFigure 9. Multiplex, markerless knockouts. A plasmid expressing Cas9 and an sgRNA that targets the LEU2 locus was transformed with (A) or without (B) a repair DNA that introduces a stop codon and destroys the sgRNA target. Shown are transformations placed on synthetic media lacking uracil, which selects only for the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid. Thus, selecting for the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid indirectly selects for cells that repaired the locus. (C) Multiple loci were targeted simultaneously, and 40 colonies each from two independent experiments were screened for the appropriate phenotype (auxotrophy). The raw number of colonies with and without repair is also shown to demonstrate that both the number of transformants and the fraction of correct clones decrease with an increasing number of targets. Finally, three colonies with the correct phenotype were then screened by colony PCR to verify proper integration of the repair DNA.\n\nDOI: 10.1017/s10509-0066-4\nACS Synth.

We also present two options, using I-Scel or CRISPR/Cas9, for generating double-stranded breaks in the chromosome that increase integration efficiencies to match or even exceed that of plasmid transformations. Finally, we adapted the CRISPR method to our standardized assembly scheme to enable multiplexed knockouts of endogenous genes. In summary, we believe this work will be a useful resource for both novice and experienced yeast biologists and engineers, and lays the foundation for a community that shares novel parts, as well as leads to greater consistency and reproducibility.\n\n■ METHODS\nStrains and Growth Media. The S. cerevisiae strain used for measuring most promoters, terminators, degradation tags, copy number, and chromosomal integrations was BY4741 (MATa his3A1 leu2A0 met15A0 ura3A0). The mating-type-specific promoters were also tested in BY4742 (MATa his3A1 leu2A0 lys2A0 ura3A0) and BY4743 (diploid cross of BY4741 and 4742). The galactose-induction experiments were conducted in a GALZ knockout of BY4741. The multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments were conducted in an S288C MATa haploid with a complete URA3 coding sequence deletion.\nConstitutive promoter and terminator characterization experiments were conducted in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Dextrose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Complete w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological), 0.85% (w/v) MOPS Free Acid (Sigma), 0.1 M Dipotassium phosphate (Sigma), 100 µg/L Zeocin (Life Technologies), buffered to pH 7.\nGalactose inductions were performed in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Raffinose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Synthetic Minus Uracil w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological), plus 0–5% (w/v) Galactose (Fisher Scientific).\nCopper inductions were performed in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Dextrose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Complete w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological), plus 0–50 µM Copper(II) Sulfate added.\nAll other experiments were conducted in synthetic media with 2% (w/v) Dextrose (Fisher Scientific), 0.67% (w/v) Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (VWR International), 0.2% (w/v) Drop-out Mix Synthetic Minus appropriate amino acids w/o Yeast Nitrogen Base (US Biological).\nYPD was used for preparing cells for transformation and recovery after heat shock: 1% (w/v) Bacto Yeast Extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto Peptone, 2% (w/v) Dextrose.\nTG1 chemically competent E. coli was used for all cloning experiments. Transformed cells were selected on Lysogeny Broth (LB) with the appropriate antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or kanamycin).\nYeast Transformations. Yeast colonies were grown to saturation overnight in YPD, then diluted 1:100 in 50 mL of fresh media and grown for 4–6 h to OD600–0.8. Cells were pelleted and washed once with water and twice with 100 mM Lithium Acetate (Sigma). Cells were then mixed by vortexing with 2.4 mL of 50% PEG-3350 (Fisher Scientific), 360 µL of 1 M Lithium Acetate, 250 µL of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), and 500 µL of water. DNA was added to 100–350 µL of transformation mixture and incubated at 42 °C for 25 min. When selecting for prototrophy, the transformation mixture was pelleted, resuspended in water, and plated directly onto solid agar plates. When selecting for drug resistance, the transformation mixture was pelleted, resuspended in YPD, incubated at 30 °C for 2 h with shaking, pelleted and washed with water, then plated onto solid agar plates.\nPlasmids designed for chromosomal integration (i.e., containing 5’ and 3’ genome homology regions without a yeast origin of replication) were digested with NotI for 10 min prior to transformation to stimulate homologous recombination. The entire digestion reaction (without DNA cleanup) was included in the transformation in place of plasmid DNA.\nGolden Gate Assembly Protocol. A Golden Gate reaction mixture was prepared as follows: 0.5 µL of each DNA insert or plasmid, 1 µL T4 DNA Ligase buffer (NEB), 0.5 µL T7 DNA Ligase (NEB), 0.5 µL restriction enzyme, and water to bring the final volume to 10 µL. The restriction enzymes used were either Baal or BsmBI (both 10 000 U/mL from NEB). The amount of DNA inserts can optionally be normalized to equimolar concentrations (~20 fmol each) to improve assembly efficiencies.\nReaction mixtures were incubated in a thermocycler according to the following program: 25 cycles of digestion and ligation (42 °C for 2 min, 16 °C for 5 min) followed by a final digestion step (60 °C for 10 min), and a heat inactivation step (80 °C for 10 min). In some cases, where noted in the text, the final digestion and heat inactivation steps were omitted.\nCloning of Parts. See Supporting Information for details on construction of new parts.\nPromoter, Terminator, and Degradation Tag Characterization. Promoter, terminator, and degradation tag testing constructs were integrated into the URA3 locus of the yeast chromosome. Constitutive promoter, terminator, and degradation tag testing constructs were selected using a Zeocin resistance cassette; mating-type and indouble promoter testing constructs were selected for uracil prototrophy.\nColonies were picked and grown in 500 µL of media in 96-deep-well blocks at 30 °C in an ATR shaker, shaking at 750 rpm until saturated. Cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh media, grown for 12–16 h, then diluted 1:3 in fresh media, and fluorescence was measured on a TECAN Safire2. For the galactose inductions, the media was switched during the dilution step from 2% dextrose to 2% raffinose with different concentrations of galactose. For the copper inductions, saturated cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh media with different concentrations of copper(II) sulfate and grown for 18 h.\nExcitation and emission wavelengths used to measure fluorescent proteins were mTurquoise2 at 435 nm/478 nm, Venus at 516 nm/530 nm, and mRuby2 at 559 nm/600 nm. Raw fluorescence values were first normalized to the OD600 of the cultures, and then normalized to the background fluorescence of cells not expressing any fluorescent protein. The median log value of biological replicates was calculated and plotted with the range.\nCopy Number Characterization. mRuby2 expression cassettes were assembled onto URA3 plasmids or integrated into the URA3 locus; Venus expression cassettes were assembled onto LEU2 plasmids or integrated into the LEU2 locus. For constructs where the two fluorescent proteins were expressed in tandem from the same locus/plasmid, they were assembled onto URA3 plasmids or integrated into the URA3\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\nACS Synthetic Biology\n\nlocus; the strain used for these constructs was prototrophic for leucine.\n\nFour colonies of each strain were picked into 400 \\(\\mu\\)L of synthetic media lacking uracil and leucine, and grown in 96-deep-well blocks at 30 °C in an ATR shaker, shaking at 750 rpm until saturated. The saturated cultures were measured for bulk fluorescence in a TECAN Safire2. The cultures were then diluted 1:100 into fresh media, grown for 4 h, and measured on a Fortessa X-20 flow cytometer.\n\nExcitation and emission wavelengths used to measure bulk fluorescence on the TECAN were Venus at 516 nm/530 nm and mRuby2 at 560 nm/590 nm. Fluorescence values were normalized and reported in the same manner as the promoter characterization experiments.\n\nThe lasers and filters used on the flow cytometer were a 488 nm laser and a FITC filter (505LP 530/30) for Venus; a 561 nm laser and PE-Texas Red filter (595LP 610/20) for mRuby2. Voltages for each channel were kept constant for all samples at all copy numbers. Fluorescence was normalized for cell size by dividing by forward-scatter. Cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo (http://www.flowjo.com).\n\nNote: the selectable auxotrophic markers for uracil and leucine used in these experiments were different from those included in the toolkit. At the time these experiments were conducted, we had designed markers that encoded for the native Ura3p and Leu2p proteins, but used alternate codons for almost every position. We also used the respective terminator sequence from Ashbya gossypii, although we used the native S. cerevisiae promoter. The reason for these changes was an attempt to construct selectable markers with orthogonal sequences that would minimize undesired recombination with the chromosome, particularly for strains that did not have clean deletions of those genes as BY4741 does. Unfortunately, some of the changes resulted in a reduced growth rate on selective media, and were abandoned in favor of the native sequences. The only other experiment to use the alternative markers was the high-efficiency integration experiment (which also used HIS3).\n\nHigh-Efficiency Integrations. The experimental strain used for the integration efficiency experiments was prepared by integrating the landing pad into BY4741 as depicted in Supporting Figure S4A. The repair DNA was constructed in two ways, with and without a CEN6/ARS4 origin. The plasmid with an origin was transformed and used to normalize the colony counts of all other transformations. The plasmid without an origin was linearized using NotI prior to transformation. The cutting plasmids expressing either I-Scel or Cas9/sgRNA were constructed onto CEN6/ARS4 plasmids with a HIS3 selection marker, but were never selected for and were presumably present only transiently in cells. The cutting plasmids either were or were not also linearized with NotI prior to transformation. 100 fmol of each DNA (cutter and/or repair) was added to 350 \\(\\mu\\)L of transformation mix. After heat shock, 1/10th of the transformation was plated onto synthetic media lacking histidine. Pictures of the plates were taken and colonies were counted using Benchling (https://benchling.com).\n\nMultiplexed Knockouts. 1 \\(\\mu g\\) of the Cas9/sgRNA plasmid (\\(\\sim\\)100 ng/\\(\\mu\\)L) and 5 \\(\\mu g\\) of linear repair DNA (\\(\\sim\\)500 ng/\\(\\mu\\)L) were added to 300 \\(\\mu\\)L of transformation mix. For the no repair controls, 10 \\(\\mu\\)L of water was added in place of the DNA. After heat shock, cells were washed with 300 \\(\\mu\\)L of water, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 \\(\\mu\\)L of water and plated entirely onto synthetic media lacking uracil.\n\nTo screen for the knockout phenotype(s), 40 colonies were picked into 500 \\(\\mu\\)L of synthetic media lacking uracil in 96-deep-well blocks and grown at 30 °C in an ATR shaker, shaking at 750 rpm. Saturated cultures were washed twice in 500 \\(\\mu\\)L of water, then diluted 1:100 into four different media, each lacking the appropriate amino acid (leucine, histidine, methionine (and cysteine), or tryptophan). These cultures were then incubated again at 30 °C at 750 rpm, and we counted the number of clones that showed growth in the correct set of media.\n\nProtopacer sequences for sgRNAs were designed using Benchling (see Supporting Table S2 for a list). See Supporting Figure S5A for details on the design of repair DNA.\n\n■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n● Supporting Information\nAll 96 plasmids described in this toolkit are available from Addgene (http://www.addgene.org).

These variants exhibit distinctive fast, medium and slow blue-to-red chromophore maturation rates that depend on the temperature. At 37 °C, the maxima of the blue fluorescence are observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence are reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively. The FTs show similar timing behavior in bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Medium-FT allowed for tracking of the intracellular dynamics of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) and determination of its age in the targeted compartments. The results indicate that LAMP-2A transport through the plasma membrane and early or recycling endosomes to lysosomes is a major pathway for LAMP-2A trafficking.  \n\nMonomeric fluorescent proteins of various emission wavelengths have become invaluable tools for studying the spatial behavior of intracellular molecules, including their localization and interaction\\(^1\\). To visualize temporal and spatial molecular events, FTs\\(^2\\), which change their emission wavelengths over time, could be especially valuable. The only currently available FT is DsRed-Timer FT (also known as DsRed-E5)\\(^3\\); however, it is a tetramer, which prevents its application as a protein fusion tag. Nevertheless, the tetrameric state of the DsRed-Timer does not limit its use to study gene activities\\(^4\\), relative age of organelles\\(^5\\) and cell differentiation\\(^3\\).  \n\nIt has been suggested that a red DsRed-like chromophore in the red fluorescent proteins (RfPs) results from an oxidation of a protonated blue form of the GFP-like chromophore, not from the green anionic form, which is a dead-end product\\(^6\\). This suggested scheme for red chromophore maturation provides a basis for developing monomeric FTs that change their color from blue to red. The most suitable templates for this appear to be the monomeric variants of DsRed\\(^7\\). One of these variants, mCherry, was chosen for a directed molecular evolution to develop three monomeric FTs with different maturation rates between the protonated blue GFP-like and the anionic red DsRed-like chromophore states.  \n\nFTs can be used as molecular genetically encoded tools to study trafficking of different cellular proteins and to provide accurate insight into the timing of intracellular processes.

An example of a longstanding dilemma is the contribution of different pathways to trafficking and final delivery of\nLAMP-2A to lysosomes. LAMP-2A is encoded by a spliced variant of the lamp2 gene and\nacts as a lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)[8,9]. LAMP-2A is sorted\nto endosomes and lysosomes through a tyrosine-based signal in its cytosolic C terminus, but\na fraction of the protein is also observed at the plasma membrane[10]. This dual location led\ninvestigators to propose the existence of both direct (Golgi to lysosomes) and indirect (through\nendocytosis from the plasma membrane) targeting of LAMP-2A to lysosomes[11]. The use of\nFTs has allowed us to study the sequence of events involved in transport of LAMP-2A to\nlysosomes and to determine the preferential pathway followed by LAMP-2A for its trafficking.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n**Development of monomeric FTs**\n\nThe gene encoding mCherry was used as a template for the multiple saturated mutagenesis at\npositions 42, 44, 65, 69, 106, 148, 203 and 224 (amino acid numbering follows that of Aequorea\n_victoria GFP; see Fig. 1a). These positions were identified either according to the X-ray_\nstructure of mCherry[12] or using experimental data regarding amino acid substitutions affecting\nmaturation of DsRed variants[13–15]. It has been shown that substitutions at these positions slow\nor accelerate formation of the red chromophore. According to the mCherry structure, residues\n42 and 44 are close to the Met65 residue of the mCherry chromophore, and residues 69, 148\nand 203 are close to the phenolic and/or imidazolinone rings of the chromophore. Residue 224\nwas found in close proximity to residue 203 and has been suggested to indirectly influence\nchromophore positioning. Therefore, a bacterial library of mutants at positions 42, 44, 65, 69,\n106, 148, 203 and 224 was screened for clones with fast, medium and slow maturation rates\nusing a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) followed by analysis of the collected colonies\non petri dishes using a fluorescence stereomicroscope.\n\nAs a result of screening the library of mutants with the site-specific substitutions at the eight\npositions indicated above, mCherry K69R and mCherry K69R A224S mutants with FT\nphenotypes were found (Supplementary Table 1 online). These mutants exhibited blue forms\nthat were not detected in the original mCherry. However, the brightness of the blue fluorescence\nwas very low in the case of mCherry K69R. The maturation rates of the red forms were slowed\nas compared to that of mCherry. Other mutations found in the analyzed variants did not lead\nto the FT phenotypes. Because the mCherry K69R A224S mutant exhibited the blue form\nearlier than the mCherry K69R variant, the former was further used for random mutagenesis\nto screen for the fast-FT phenotype. Consequently, the mCherry K69R mutant was used as a\ntemplate for random mutagenesis aimed to screen for medium-FT and slow-FT phenotypes.\nSequential rounds of the random mutagenesis followed by screening of mutant clones using\nFACS and fluorescence stereomicroscopy were applied. The bacterial libraries of random\nmutants typically consisted of 10[6] to 10[7] clones.\n\nThe number of rounds for random mutagenesis varied depending on the specific FT phenotype\nand consisted of four, five and three rounds for the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT,\nrespectively. Over several rounds of random mutagenesis, the fluorescence intensities of both\nblue and red forms of the best FT variants increased and reached plateaus (Supplementary Fig.\n1 online). When we were not able to find a better variant in the next round of mutagenesis, we\nstopped improvement of that FT using random mutagenesis.\n\nA key mutation found in the first round of mutagenesis for all FT phenotypes was L84W.\nVariants containing this amino acid substitution exhibited substantially brighter blue and red\nfluorescence intensities. Mutations at position 18 such as M18V and M18L resulted in a slight\n\n_Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1._\n\n===== Page 3 =====\n\ndecrease of the red intensity that, however, was compensated by a large increase of the blue fluorescence. Therefore we decided to choose variants with these mutations for the next random mutagenesis.\n\nDuring the subsequent rounds of mutagenesis, several additional internal positions such as 112, 143, 152, 179 and 205, which contained important substitutions, were found. For example, in the fast-FT phenotype, the mutation S112T increased the brightness of both red and blue forms to about the same extent. In the medium-FT phenotype, mutations M143K and L205M increased the brightness of the blue form and increased the efficiency of the blue-to-red chromophore maturation. The introduction of M152L and M152I amino acid substitutions in medium-FT variants substantially increased the brightness of the red but not the blue form. Several mutations such as F63C, S112C and A179V reduced chromophore maturation rates; however, only the latter mutation did not decrease the brightness of the blue form, and therefore we chose this mutation for the slow-FT phenotype.\n\nTo make sure that during the multistage screening and selection procedures we did not miss mutants with some advantageous substitutions at the identified key positions, we applied the best fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT variants found in the random mutagenesis for an additional saturated site-specific mutagenesis at positions 69, 84, 143, 179, 203 and 205. However, no better FT versions were found. The final residues neighboring the chromophore in each construct are shown in Figure 1b-d, and all important mutations found during the molecular evolution of mCherry into the FTs are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nProperties of FTs in vitro\n\nThe fluorescence properties of the new constructs were investigated (Fig. 2). The blue forms of the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT had excitation/emission peaks of 403/466, 401/464 and 402/465 nm, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2a for fast-FT; other FTs exhibited similar spectra). The respective red forms had excitation/emission peaks of 583/606, 579/600 and 583/604 nm. The absorbance of both forms had the same maxima as the fluorescence excitation spectra. The external mutations in the FTs were located outside of the dimerizing interfaces observed in the DsRed structure\\(^16\\). Subsequently, like the parental mCherry, all FTs exhibited the monomeric behavior (Supplementary Fig. 2 online).\n\nMolar extinction coefficients and quantum yields of the blue forms of the FTs were in the range of 33,400-49,700 M\\(^{-1}\\)cm\\(^{-1}\\) and 0.30-0.41, respectively (Table 1). The fluorescence of the blue forms exhibited high pH stability, with pKa values below 3.0 (Fig. 2g). For comparison, the best blue fluorescent protein reported so far, EBFP2, has lower pH stability, with a pKa value of about 4.5. Extinction coefficients of the FT red forms were higher than those of the blue forms and varied between 73,100 and 84,200 M\\(^{-1}\\)cm\\(^{-1}\\). The quantum yields for the FT red forms varied in the range of 0.05-0.09. The fluorescences of the red forms had pH stabilities similar to those of the parental mCherry, with pKa values of 4.1-4.7 (Fig. 2h). Because the fluorescence of both blue and red forms decreased with acidification, the ratio between these fluorescence intensities changed with pH notably less than the red signal but more than the blue signal (Fig. 2i). For all FTs, the ratio changed less than 8% within the pH range of 5.4-7.4.\n\nDuring the FT maturation, the fluorescence of the blue forms increased to its maximum value, and after that decreased to zero (Fig. 2a-c). The fluorescence of the red forms increased with time with some delay and then reached a plateau. At 37 °C the maxima of the blue fluorescence intensities were observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence intensities were reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively, which corresponds to the half-times of the maturation for the red FT forms. These characteristic times increased at lower temperatures such as 16 °C and 25 °C and decreased at higher temperatures such as 45 °C (Table 1). The ratios between the red and blue\n\n===== Page 4 =====\n\nfluorescence intensities exhibited parabolic growth dependencies with time for each FT. The higher the temperature, the faster the growth of the red-to-blue ratio; this observation provided a single meaning for the age of the particular FT (Fig. 2d-f). These ratio curves can be easily adapted for other instruments using the ratio of the reference dyes. Furthermore, these data suggest that calibration curves based on the FT red-to-blue ratio can be used to determine the time from the start of FT production under any specific conditions.\n\nTo quantitatively describe the chromophore conversion pathway in the FTs, we applied kinetic model (1). This model was based on the proposed earlier mechanism for chromophore formation in tetrameric DsRed protein [6]. A spectrally undetectable C-form, which represents a cyclized chromophore-forming tripeptide in the reduced (and therefore colorless) state, is converted into a blue form (B-form), which then turns into a red form (R-form) (Scheme 1). It has been shown that in fluorescent proteins, polypeptide folding and cyclization of the chromophore-forming tripeptide occur substantially faster than the oxidation steps [17]. The formation of the B-form precedes the red chromophore formation in many red FPs including DsRed and HeRed1. It has been suggested that the B-form is a common intermediate for the red chromophores [6]. For the FTs, model (1) consisted of the following kinetic steps:\n\n\\[\\text{C}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{B}}}\\text{B}\\xrightarrow{k_{1}}\\text{I}\\xrightarrow {k_{\\text{R}}}\\text{R}\\] (1)\n\nwhere C and I are the nonfluorescent chromophore forms, B and R are the blue and red forms of FTs, and \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\), \\(k_{\\text{I}}\\) and \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) are the kinetic rate constants [6] (Scheme 1). It has been suggested that the B-form is a protonated (neutral) form of the GFP-like chromophore p-(hydroxybenzylidene)-imidazolin-5-one [18]. This form results from an oxidation of the Tyr66 αC-βC bond of the C-form with the formation of a double bond. The mature deprotonated (anionic) R-form contains an additional double bond between the α carbon and amide nitrogen of Met65. The I-forms may present an unstable short-lived carbanion intermediate, which is formed from the B-form by a proton abstraction from the α carbon of Met65. The formation of the carbanion intermediate is possible because of stabilization, by a side chain of Arg69 (which is introduced to all FTs by site-specific mutagenesis), of the negative charge delocalized within the aromatic system.\n\nTwo steps in the mechanism of red chromophore formation (C\\(\\rightarrow\\)B and I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R) are irreversible because both of them are accompanied by chromophore oxidation with the formation of the double bonds [6, 12, 16]. The step B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I is the deprotonation of the neutral blue form with formation of at least one intermediate compound, such as the carbanion. Because the exact number and chemical nature of the intermediate compounds is unknown and particularly because the next I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R oxidation step is irreversible, we have approximated the B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I process by irreversible reaction.\n\nWe used model (1) above to fit the experimental FT maturation curves obtained _in vitro_ for all three purified proteins at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C (presented in Fig. 2c for the fast-FT at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C). We further determined rate constants for each chromophore maturation step in the FTs at different temperatures (Scheme 1 and Supplementary Table 2 online). The \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\) constants were substantially larger than \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) for the fast-FT and slow-FT, which indicates that the I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R steps were the limiting reactions for red chromophore formation in these FTs. In the case of medium-FT, the limiting step for red form formation was B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I. This suggests that the long-lived intermediate I-form or blue B-form might be responsible for the delays in the formation of the FT red forms--that is, for the timing behavior.\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 5\n\nBehavior of FTs in different cell types\n\nTo study the behavior of the FTs in a system other than bacteria, we expressed them in stable clones of Drosophila melanogaster Schrieder’s 2 (S2) cells under the control of the inducible metallothionein promoter\\(^{19}\\). After the induction with copper sulfate of the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT for 0.5, 1 and 2 h, respectively, expression was stopped. The blue and red fluorescence of the S2 cells was then analyzed using flow cytometry at different times during 15 days of cell growth at 25 °C (Fig. 3).\n\nTo study timing in mammalian cells, the FTs were expressed in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells at 37 °C using the Tet-Off system\\(^{20}\\). Several hours after the transfection, transcription was stopped by addition of a doxycycline, and later the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at different times (see Fig. 4a for slow-FT; other FTs resulted in similar histograms).\n\nAs with the purified FTs and the proteins expressed in bacteria, the blue fluorescence of the insect cells at 25 °C and mammalian cells at 37 °C expressing the FTs increased, reached its maxima, and then decreased to almost zero. The red fluorescence also increased with time; however, in contrast to the in vitro data, it then slowly decreased (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4b). Furthermore, for all FTs the growth of the blue and red forms and the decrease of the blue forms were slower than those for the purified FTs. These data indicate that (i) the translation of FTs occurs for some time after termination of transcription with doxycycline or removal of copper sulfate and (ii) like other proteins, the FTs are susceptible to proteasomal degradation.\n\nTo quantitatively describe the kinetics of the blue and red FT forms in live S2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 3 online), we modified the above model (1) with two minimal additional kinetic steps and got the following kinetic model (2):\n\n\\[N \\xrightarrow{k_C} C \\xrightarrow{k_B} B \\xrightarrow{k_1} I \\xrightarrow{k_R} R \\xrightarrow{k_D} D\\]\n\nwhere N is ribonucleic acid, D is the degraded nonfluorescent FTs and \\( k_C \\) and \\( k_D \\) are the kinetic rate constants. The first step (from ribonucleic acid to cyclized chromophore-forming tripeptide form) reflects prolongation of protein translation from the ribonucleic acid N after termination of its transcription. The second step (from the red FT to the degraded nonfluorescent FT) reflects degradation of FTs in live cells to the nondetectable D form.\n\nThe resulting values of \\( k_C \\) for S2 cells were rather close for all FTs (0.009-0.013 h\\(^{-1}\\): Supplementary Table 2). This was also true for the \\( k_C \\) rate constants in HeLa cells (0.29 h\\(^{-1}\\) for medium-FT and 0.30 h\\(^{-1}\\) for slow-FT), which indicates similar lifetimes for the FT mRNAs in the same type of cells. The \\( k_C \\) values for the HeLa cells suggest that the mRNA amount should be 10% after 8 h and 3% after 12 h incubation with doxycycline. A similar time course for the activity of the luciferase has been observed after inhibition of its transcription with tetracycline\\(^{20}\\). Within 8 h, luciferase activity dropped to about 10% and was less than 2% of its original value after 12 h\\(^{20}\\). The \\( k_D \\) values observed for the FTs at 37 °C were in good agreement with previous reports on the 24 h half-life time for GFP in mammalian cell cytoplasm after the inhibition of its transcription and translation\\(^{21}\\).\n\nIntracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A\n\nTo explore the advantage of the FTs in vivo, we used FTs to study the intracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A. Previous studies on LAMPs trafficking using biochemical and immunofluorescence approaches had suggestedthat LAMPs canreach thelysosomevia twointracellular routes: a direct pathway from the Golgi to the late endosomes and lysosomes\\(^{22,23}\\), and an indirect pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane following\n\n*Nat Chem Biol.* Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1.\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nthe secretory pathway, and then to lysosomes via endocytosis[24-26]. Although it was initially\nconsidered that the pool of LAMPs at the plasma membrane was only evident under certain\nconditions (such as platelet activation or certain tumors), later studies knocking down adaptor\ntrafficking proteins demonstrated that a portion of cellular LAMPs can be detected at the plasma\nmembrane even under normal physiological conditions (reviewed in ref. [10]). In fact, analysis\nof chimera proteins of the luminal region of LAMP-1 and the three different cytosolic tails of\nLAMP-2 revealed that the variants reaching the plasma membrane were mainly LAMP-2A\nand LAMP-2B (ref. 27). However, in most of the previous studies, the plasma membrane\nlocation of the LAMPs was analyzed at a steady state. Although the combined use of surface\nbiotinylation and cellular permeabilization helped to demonstrate that some membrane LAMPs\nare internalized, it was not possible to determine which fraction of the total LAMPs transits\nthrough the plasma membrane in a dynamic manner. Lastly, in all the previous studies relying\non biochemical analysis, individual differences from cell to cell on the dynamics of\ninternalization of LAMPs from the plasma membrane could not be determined. We predicted\nthat using LAMP-2A-FT fusion proteins, we could possibly estimate the age of the LAMP-2A\nmolecules in different cellular compartments during their trafficking and determine the main\nLAMP-2A targeting mechanism.\n\nTo choose an FT with the appropriate timing behavior, we first tested the localization of\nLAMP-2A fusion constructs with all FTs expressed under the constitutive cytomegalovirus\npromoter. Several types of mammalian cells exhibiting different levels of CMA activity were\ntransiently transfected with this construct (see Supplementary Fig. 4 online for Cos-1 cells).\nWe observed that in the case of LAMP-2A-fast-FT, the blue form mainly localized in an area\ncompatible with the Golgi, and the red form was visualized as vesicular structures (endosomes\nor lysosomes). The blue form of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT localized in the Golgi, plasma\nmembrane and vesicular structures, and the red form was predominantly detected in the\nvesicular formations. In the case of the LAMP-2A-slow-FT, the blue form was observed in the\nvesicular structures, with only a small amount at the cell membrane. All of the red form of the\nLAMP-2A-slow-FT was observed in the vesicles. Because the LAMP-2A-medium-FT fusion\ncan be detected in several cellular compartments at the same time, this construct was further\napplied to study trafficking using the Tet-Off system.\n\nWe found that at 1 and 6 h after the pulse-chase expression, an early blue form of the LAMP-2Amedium-FT was the major fluorescent form observed in live HeLa Tet-Off cells (Fig. 4c). The\namount of the blue form then gradually decreased until its complete disappearance at 63 h,\nwhereas the late red form of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT increased, reaching its maximum\nbetween 36.5 and 63 h (Fig. 4c). The newly synthesized fusion protein was slowly trafficked\nthrough the Golgi, where it could be detected for up to 12 h. Between 6 and 21 h, a percentage\nof the blue form was also observed at the plasma membrane, which, however, was never\nhighlighted with the late red protein. These data indicate that LAMP-2A at the plasma\nmembrane did not result from the fusion of pre-existing lysosomal compartments, but was\nprimarily targeted there from the Golgi after synthesis.\n\nTo identify the nature of the vesicular compartments in which LAMP-2A-medium-FT was\ndetected, we applied transferrin-Alexa 488 to visualize early and recycling endosomes, and\nLysotracker Green to stain late endosomes and lysosomes (Supplementary Fig. 5 online). At\n6 h after the expression, we observed almost complete co-localization of the late red form of\nthe fusion protein with transferrin-Alexa 488. At 12 and 21 h the co-localization became partial,\nand only a very small fraction of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT merged with transferrin-Alexa\n488 at later times. In contrast, co-localization of the red form with Lysotracker Green was\npartial at 6 and 12 h, but became almost complete at all times after 21 h.\n\n_Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1._\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 7\n\nBecause the intense blue fluorescence at the perinuclear region could be masking individual lysosomal structures and thus might complicate discrimination between the different compartments in that region, we also imaged the blue form of LAMP-2A-medium-FT in combination with Lysotracker Green to discriminate between compartments based on a red-to-blue ratio. The regions where blue or red fluorescence was merged with Lysotracker Green were referred to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Bright blue fluorescence was not observed in the regions merged with Lysotracker Green at early times after LAMP-2A-medium-FT expression (Supplementary Fig. 6 online). The red signal of LAMP-2A-medium-FT in the regions co-stained with Lysotracker Green was substantially larger than that in the perinuclear region. Even when lysosomes identified with Lysotracker staining were occasionally found in the perinuclear region, their red fluorescence was substantially brighter than the red fluorescence in other parts of the perinuclear region that were not stained with Lysotracker.\n\nTo determine the nature of the intense blue signal in the perinuclear region observed at earlier times of pulse-chase expression of LAMP-2A-medium-FT, we used β-1,4-galactosyltransferase-EYFP (GalT-EYFP) as a Golgi marker[28, 29, 30]. GalT is anchored in the membranes of the trans-Golgi network[30, 31, 32]. The Golgi marker merged with the intense blue signal localized in the perinuclear region at 1 and 6 h after expression (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). At later times, the blue signal only coincided partially with GalT-EYFP, whereas co-localization of the red signal with the Golgi marker was not observed at any time after the LAMP-2A expression. These results support the observation that the bright blue fluorescence observed at the perinuclear region corresponds to molecules of LAMP-2A still in the Golgi.\n\nWe took advantage of the FT monomeric states to estimate the mean age for the LAMP-2A-medium-FT molecules in different organelles. It is unlikely that a fusion partner such as LAMP-2A affects maturation of the FT chromophore, which is tightly shielded inside of the β-can. Therefore, the same maturation times of blue and red forms of the free FT and FT fusion construct should correspond to the same time after FT expression in both cases. To preserve functionality of the chimera we fused the FTs to the N terminus of LAMP-2A, which is located in the lysosomal lumen. We determined that the red-to-blue ratio for medium-FT had small changes in the pH range of 5.4-7.4 (Fig. 2i). This is an important issue because pH values close to 5.4 have been detected in late endosomes and lysosomes, whereas pH values not exceeding 7.4 have been observed in Golgi, early and recycling endosomes, and cytoplasm. These observations allowed us to apply the kinetic model that successfully described spectral changes of the cytoplasmically expressed FTs in live cells. In other words, by comparing the red-to-blue ratios for free medium-FT detected with flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 3) to those for LAMP-2A-medium-FT obtained using cell imaging (Fig. 4c), we have estimated the mean ages of the fusion construct in each of the targeted compartments at various times after its expression has stopped (Table 2). The evaluated mean ages in different compartments indicate the indirect intracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A from the Golgi through the plasma membrane and early or recycling endosomes to the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. 12 h after expression, most of the protein resides in the late endosomes and lysosomes.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe primary aim of this investigation was development of new tools to study the spatial and temporal distribution of individual proteins in live cells. As a result of the mutagenesis screening, we have found three monomeric FTs with distinctive blue-to-red conversion timing, which we named fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT. The fast-FT has five amino acid mutations as compared to the original mCherry. Among them K69R, L84W and A224S are internal to the β-can mCherry fold and E34K and S151T are external to the fold. The medium-FT exhibits nine amino acid substitutions, of which K69R, L84W, M152I and L205M are internal, and N23D, T43S, Q194L, Y221C and R227H are external. The slow-FT has only four mutations,\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\nof which K69R, L84W and A179V are internal and E30V is external. The immediate environment of the chromophores of the FTs is shown in Figure 1b-d.\n\nAll FTs contain K69R and L84W substitutions. According to the mCherry structure[12], a residue at position 84 influences positioning of residue 69. For example, K84L substitution in mCherry relative to the original DsRed resulted in a 2.7-Å shift of Lys69. Similarly, L84W mutation can lead to a change of position of Arg69 in FTs. On the other hand, the amino acid at position 69 alone plays an important role in formation of the red chromophore. Lysine or arginine amino acids are almost always found at this position in RFPs[14]. In DsRed, K69R is the only substitution that preserved formation of the red chromophore, while slowing its maturation, whereas other substitutions at this position resulted in green chromophores[33]. Therefore Arg69 and Trp84 appear to be the key amino acids responsible for the timing behavior of the mCherry-based blue-to-red FTs.\n\nOther substitutions observed in the FTs are possibly involved in time-tuning of each particular FT. In the mCherry structure, Ala224 forms van der Waals contact with Ile203, which is in close proximity to the chromophore[12]. The A224S substitution in the fast-FT introduces an additional hydroxyl group affecting positioning of Ile203.\n\nLeu205 in mCherry forms several van der Waals contacts with the tyrosine in the chromophore. In addition, Met152 forms van der Waals contacts with Glu150 and Tyr185, which are in close proximity to the chromophore. Therefore, M152I and L205M mutations in the medium-FT can influence red chromophore maturation.\n\nThe Ala179 residue in the mCherry structure forms van der Waals contacts with the internal amino acids Met98 and Phe100. However, in the DsRed structure[16], Met98 and Phe100 have van der Waals contacts with Val105. As compared to DsRed, DsRed-E5 FT has only two substitutions, V105A and S203T (ref. 3). Therefore we speculate that the A179V mutation observed in the slow-FT may affect the maturation rate of the red chromophore, much like V105A substitution in DsRed-E5.\n\nIn this work we demonstrate the advantages of FTs for visualizing temporal and spatial molecular events using as example the intracellular trafficking of a lysosomal membrane protein. Based on the red-to-blue ratios observed for LAMP-2A-medium-FT in different compartments at various imaging time points, one may suggest the following major intracellular traffic pattern for the protein: Golgi → plasma membrane → early and recycling endosomes → late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data support the predominant indirect targeting of LAMP-2A to lysosomes[11]. The relatively low LAMP-2A levels observed at the plasma membrane suggest a rather short retention time for the protein in this compartment. In fact, at various imaging time points the mean ages of the LAMP-2A-medium-FTs in early and recycling endosomes differ substantially from those in the Golgi (Table 2). On the other hand, the difference between the ages of LAMP-2A proteins in the Golgi and those at the plasma membrane is small, which suggests that LAMP-2A is present there for a rather limited time. Therefore, any additional protein flow from the Golgi directly to early and recycling endosomes and then to lysosomes seems to be unlikely.\n\nThe use of FTs to study this process has also allowed us to identify a small fraction of LAMP-2A that recycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane. This conclusion is based on the following: if LAMP-2A travels from the Golgi to early endosomes and then recycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane, we should see two populations of endosomes with the different ages of LAMP-2A-FT. The first population would have a red-to-blue ratio smaller than or equal to that on the plasma membrane, while the second population could have a red-to-blue ratio larger than that on the membrane. The microscopy data clearly indicate that for the majority of early and recycling endosomes, the red-to-blue ratio is larger than that on the\n\n===== Page 9 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 9\n\nplasma membrane. However, there is a small fraction (less than 20%) of early and recycling endosomes that have red-to-blue ratios comparable to those on the membrane, but never smaller. Consequently, a quite small fraction of LAMP-2A is involved in the recycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes.\n\nOur results provide, to our knowledge for the first time, an in vivo analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a lysosomal membrane protein. Specifically, the FTs allowed us (i) to follow the trafficking of LAMP-2A, (ii) to confirm the universality of the indirect pathway without having to introduce genetic modifications in the adaptor proteins (thus allowing us to avoid possible compensatory mechanisms), (iii) to establish that engagement of LAMP-2A through the indirect pathway is not a default mechanism, but instead, as proposed through the genetic analysis, affects a large percentage of the intracellular protein and (iv) to estimate the time of trafficking to the plasma membrane and from the membrane to lysosomes in live intact cells, without subjecting the cell membrane to modifications with biotinylation or permeabilization.\n\nThe analysis of LAMP-2A behavior demonstrates the advantages of using monomeric FTs to elucidate the dynamics of intracellular proteins under various physiological and pathological conditions. The monomeric FT proteins will also allow for identification of recycling events among compartments, temporal tracking of molecules before and after a particular cellular event (without the need for additional labeling or artificial photoswitching) and timing of particular intracellular post-translational modifications traceable by fluorescent procedures such as ubiquitination and farnesylation. Selection of the appropriate FT is an important step to reveal timing of the specific cellular process to be studied. Therefore, availability of three FTs with distinctive chromophore maturation times will be useful for studies of cellular processes with substantially different time scales. Furthermore, the blue and red fluorescent colors provide the possibility to use FTs together with GFPs for protein multicolor labeling in the cell. The FT monomeric states will be useful for FRET applications with GFP-labeled FRET partners. In contrast to tetrameric DsRed-E5, the monomeric FTs will allow a sequential bimolecular fluorescence complementation of FT molecules followed by FT maturation to determine the intracellular timing of protein-protein interactions\\(^2\\).\n\nMETHODS\nMutagenesis\n\nThe gene encoding mCherry was PCR amplified as a BgIII-EcoRI fragment and inserted into a pBAD/His-B vector (Invitrogen). Site-specific mutagenesis of the gene encoding mCherry was performed using QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For simultaneous mutagenesis at several positions, an overlap-extension approach was applied\\(^3\\)4. Random mutagenesis was performed with GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using conditions resulting in a mutation frequency of up to 16 mutations per 1,000 base pairs. After mutagenesis, a mixture of the mutants was electroporated into LMG194 bacteria (Invitrogen).\n\nLibrary screening\n\nTo find FTs with distinctive timing behavior, libraries of mutants cloned under the arabinose promoter were screened for bright blue and non-red clones at different times after the induction of protein expression—usually 1, 4 or 24 h for the relatively fast, medium and slow chromophore formation rates, respectively. Then, protein production was suppressed with glucose, and the selected clones were re-screened for the bright red and non-blue phenotype 24 and 48 h later for the fast-medium and the slow maturation rates, respectively. After each round of screening, about 8-10 mutants were considered as promising for the next rounds of mutagenesis; these mutants were characterized by (i) distinctive blue-to-red fluorescence\n\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nNai Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1.\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\nchanges, (ii) the brightest fluorescence of both blue and red forms, (iii) specific timing for blue-to-red changes and (iv) external amino acid substitutions that were not located at the dimerizing interfaces observed in the DsRed structure. Further details are described in the Supplementary Methods online.\n\n### Protein characterization\n\nMaturation of the blue and red forms was studied at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To determine extinction coefficients, we relied on measuring the mature chromophore concentrations [35], taking into account that the extinction coefficient of the model compound of the tyrosine-containing GFP-like chromophores is 44,000 M\\({}^{-1}\\) cm\\({}^{-1}\\) at 447 nm in 1 M NaOH [35] and about 28,500 M\\({}^{-1}\\) cm\\({}^{-1}\\) at 382 nm in 1 M HCl [36]. In the case of blue forms, freshly purified proteins were acid-denatured. In the case of red forms, the proteins matured at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 24-48 h and afterwards were alkali-denatured. To determine quantum yields, the fluorescence intensities of the blue and red forms were compared with equally absorbing EGFP (quantum yield is 0.60; ref. [37]) and mCherry (quantum yield is 0.22; ref. [38]), respectively. pH titrations were performed using a series of buffers (100 mM NaOAc, 300 mM NaCl for pH 2.5-5.0, and 100 mM NaH\\({}_{2}\\)PO\\({}_{4}\\), 300 mM NaCl for pH 4.5-9.0). All fluorescence measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon). The ratio between the emissions of 0.1 \\(\\upmu\\)M rhodamine-101 in 0.01% (w/v) HCl in ethanol at 604 nm (excited at 580 nm) and 10 \\(\\upmu\\)M quinine sulfate in 0.1 M H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) at 465 nm (excited at 402 nm) under the identical instrumental conditions at 25 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C was 33.7.\n\n### Kinetic model for FT maturation\n\nTo quantitatively describe the chromophore conversion pathway in the FTs, we considered two kinetic models, (1) and (3). These models were based on the proposed earlier mechanism for the chromophore formation in tetrameric DsRed protein [6]. Model (3) consisted of the following kinetic steps:\n\n\\[\\text{C}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{B}}}\\text{B}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{R}}} \\text{R}\\] (3)\n\nModel (1) extends (3) by introducing an intermediate I-form between the B-form and R-form (see above) [6]. We used models (1) and (3) to fit the experimental FT maturation curves obtained _in vitro_ for all three purified proteins at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C using the Gepasi chemical kinetics simulation software [39] with the maximal amount of the red forms accepted as 100%. Model (3) described poorly the experimental data on the kinetics of the maturation of the B-form and R-form in all three FTs. The simulated curves for model (3) had coefficients of determination, \\(R^{2}\\), in the range of 0.40-0.62 for the different FTs. The introduction of only a single I-intermediate in model (3) substantially improved the quantitative description of the experimentally observed maturation kinetics for the B-form and R-form. For all three FTs, the simulated curves for model (1) provided \\(R^{2}\\) values above 0.99. Therefore we further applied model (1) to describe the kinetic behavior of both the blue and red forms.\n\nTo quantitatively describe kinetics of the blue and red FT forms in live S2 and HeLa cells, we used kinetic model (2) (see above). The mean brightnesses for the blue and red forms measured by flow cytometry for the FTs cytoplasmically expressed in S2 and HeLa Tet-Off cells were fitted with kinetic model (2) using the Gepasi software [39]. For fitting, the kinetic constants \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\), \\(k_{\\text{I}}\\) and \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) were kept the same as for the purified proteins.\n\n### FACS sorting of _D. melanogaster_ S2 and HeLa Tet-Off cells\n\nFT expression in the stable S2 pre-clonal cell mixture was induced with 1 mM of CuSO\\({}_{4}\\) for 0.5 h for fast-FT, for 1 h for medium-FT and for 2 h for slow-FT. At specific times after either\n\n===== Page 11 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 11\n\nwashing out of CuSO\\(_4\\) (S2) or addition of doxycycline (HeLa), the cells were analyzed with a MoFlo cell sorter using excitation laser lines and emission filters similar to those used for the screening of bacterial libraries.\n\nMicroscopy imaging\nImaging of HeLa, Cos-1, NIH3T3 and HeLa Tet-Off cells was performed 13-122 h after transfection. In the case of HeLa Tet-Off cells, doxycycline was added 12 h after the transfection to stop protein expression. Cells were imaged using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a \\(\\times 100\\) oil immersion objective lens, with custom blue (390/40 nm exciter, 460/40 nm emitter) and red (570/30 nm exciter, 615/40 nm emitter) filter sets (Chroma), that was operated with SlideBook 4.1 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Because FTs have a tendency to photoconvert from the blue to the red form with high-intensity violet light, which may cause light-induced chromophore maturation, cell images were first acquired in the red channel and then in the blue channel. For quantification of red and blue fluorescence intensities in cellular regions of interest, the background autofluorescence measured in the respective regions of nonfluorescent cells on the same coverslip was usually subtracted.\n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank J.

The “5’ forward” and “3’ reverse” primers bind to the native sequence in the genome, immediately upstream and downstream of the 5’ and 3’ homology sequences, respectively. The “5’ reverse” and “3’ forward” primers bind to the barcodes added within the homology sequence parts and are not present in the genome. Because these barcodes are included within the Type 7 and Type 8b homology parts, the primer pairs are only dependent on which locus is being targeted, not on the genes that are being integrated or the selectable marker being used. A correct integration into a given locus would give ~500bp bands when the 5’ forward + 5’ reverse and 3’ forward + 3’ reverse primer pairs are used, whereas the native strain or an off-target integration would give no bands.\n\n6\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nmRuby2 fluorescence (fold over background)\n\nmTurquoise2 fluorescence (fold over background)\n\nVenus fluorescence (fold over background)\n\nSupplementary Figure S1.

In this case, the two genes are cloned in tandem and expressed from a single chromosomal locus or plasmid. At high copy, high expression of one gene appears to reduce the average expression of the second. Single-cell fluorescence data in Figure 7 shows two subpopulations, one with the expected level of fluorescence and another with reduced fluorescence, which explains the lowered average of bulk measurements.

It should be noted that Types are technically defined only by their flank-\ning overhangs, and the contents need not necessarily match the biologically-defined functions \nwe describe (Supplementary Figure S6). However, in order to ensure compatibility between \nall parts designed by all researchers, we recommend that new parts be designed to match the \nTypes defined here. \n \n \nSupplementary Figure S6\n\n===== Page 13 [text layer] =====\n\n13 \nType 1: 5’ Assembly Connector \n \n \nType 1 parts are flanked by CCCT and AACG (Supplementary Figure S7A). Typically, this \nType contains non-coding, non-regulatory sequences that are used to direct assembly of multi-\ngene plasmids. \nThe Type 1 part plasmids included in the toolkit contain a 143bp concatenation of barcode se-\nquences used in the systematic deletion of yeast genes\n1, a BsmBI recognition site and unique \noverhang, and a 21bp barcode scar (again, from the systematic deletion collection) (Supple-\nmentary Figure S7B). We designate these sequences as Assembly Connectors, and the nomen-\nclature used is “ConLX” where X = 1, 2, 3, etc. The BsmBI site is oriented such that the re-\nstriction enzyme digests the sequence downstream of the recognition sequence. \nThere are also ConLX’ parts, where the structure instead contains first a reversed BsmBI site \n(digests upstream) followed by the 143bp sequence (and no barcode scar) (Supplementary \nFigure S7C). The purpose of this alternate Assembly Connector is for generation of multi-gene \nbackbone plasmids (see the detailed description of assembly scheme below). To simplify the \ntoolkit, we include a single reversed Assembly Connector, which we designate ConLS’ and its \ncognate forward version, ConLS (S for Start), although any numbered Assembly Connector \ncan have a reversed version if desired. \nFinally, the Type 1 parts in this toolkit also include an EcoRI and XbaI site for BioBrick compat-\nibility of the assembled cassettes and multi-gene plasmids. \nCCCT\n...GGTCTCA\nTTGC\n...CCAGAGTGGGA\nAACGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 1\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCCCTGAATTCGCATCTAGA(N)143CGTCTCANNNN(N)21\nBsmBI\nCTTAAGCGTAGATCT(N)143GCAGAGTNNNN(N)21TTGC\nEcoRI\nXbaI\nC\nCCCTGAATTCGCATCTAGANNNNTGAGACG(N)143\nBsmBI\nCTTAAGCGTAGATCTNNNNACTCTGC(N)143TTGC\nEcoRI\nXbaI\nSupplementary Figure S7\n\n===== Page 14 [text layer] =====\n\n14 \nType 2: Promoter \n \n \nType 2 parts are flanked by AACG and TATG (Supplementary Figure S8A). Typically, this \nType contains a promoter. The downstream overhang doubles as the start codon for the sub-\nsequent Type 3 or 3a coding sequence. Additionally, all the promoters in this toolkit have a \nBglII site immediately preceding the start codon (overlapping the downstream overhang) for \nBglBrick compatibility (Supplementary Figure S8B). \n \nType 3: Coding Sequence \n \n \nType 3 parts are flanked by TATG and ATCC (Supplementary Figure S9A). Typically, this \nType contains a coding sequence. As discussed above, the TATG overhang includes a start co-\ndon so coding sequences should begin with the second codon. The ATCC overhang was de-\nsigned to enable read-through for protein fusions. If a stop codon is omitted from the part, and \ntwo bases are added before the overhang, the resulting NNATCC can be used as a two amino \nacid linker to a Type 4 or 4a C-terminal fusion. The Type 3 parts in this toolkit all omit the stop \ncodon and add a GG, resulting in GGATCC, which serves a dual purpose. First, the resulting \nGly-Ser linker is relatively innocuous; and second, the sequence is a BamHI recognition site, \nwhich enables BglBrick compatibility (Supplementary Figure S9B). We highly recommend \nfollowing this convention unless the protein in question is sensitive to C-terminal modifica-\ntions. \nAACG\n...GGTCTCA\nATAC\n...CCAGAGTTTGC\nTATGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 2\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nAACGNNN...NNNAGATC\nNNN...NNNTCTAGATAC\nBglII\nPromoter\nTATG\n...GGTCTCA\nTAGG\n...CCAGAGTATAC\nATCCTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 3\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nTATGNNN...NNNGG\nNNN...NNNCCTAGG\nBamHI\nGly-Ser\nCDS\nSupplementary Figure S8 \nSupplementary Figure S9\n\n===== Page 15 [text layer] =====\n\n15 \nType 3a: N-terminal Coding Sequence \n \n \nType 3 parts can be split into 3a and 3b parts for greater flexibility for making protein fusions. \nType 3a parts are flanked by TATG and TTCT (Supplementary Figure S10A). As with Type 3 \nparts, these typically contain coding sequences, and can be used for fusing N-terminal tags \n(such as the degradation tags described in the main text). Again, as with Type 3 parts, the stop \ncodon should be omitted and two bases should be added before the TTCT overhang if protein \nfusions are desired. The Type 3a parts in this toolkit add a GG, resulting in GGTTCT, another \nGly-Ser linker (Supplementary Figure S10B). \n \nType 3b: Coding Sequence \n \n \nType 3b parts are flanked by TTCT and ATCC (Supplementary Figure S11A). As with Type 3 \nand 3a parts, these typically contain coding sequences. Again, the start codon should be re-\nmoved for direct fusions to the Type 3a preceding it, and two bases should be added before \nthe ATCC overhang if C-terminal fusions are desired. As with the Type 3 parts, all Type 3b \nparts in this toolkit add a GG, resulting in GGATCC (Gly-Ser/BamHI site) (Supplementary \nFigure S11B). \nTATG\n...GGTCTCA\nAAGA\n...CCAGAGTATAC\nTTCTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 3a\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nTATGNNN...NNNGG\nNNN...NNNCCAAGA\nGly-Ser\nCDS\nTTCT\n...GGTCTCA\nTAGG\n...CCAGAGTAAGA\nATCCTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 3b\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nTTCTNNN...NNNGG\nNNN...NNNCCTAGG\nBamHI\nGly-Ser\nCDS\nSupplementary Figure S10 \nSupplementary Figure S11\n\n===== Page 16 [text layer] =====\n\n16 \nType 4: Terminator \n \n \nType 4 parts are flanked by ATCC and GCTG (Supplementary Figure S12A). Typically, this \nType contains a transcriptional terminator. As described above, the convention for a Type 3 or \n3b is to omit the stop codon and allow read-through of a GGATCC (Gly-Ser) linker. Therefore, \nthe Type 4 should encode an in-frame stop codon before the transcriptional terminator. The \nType 4 parts in this toolkit begin with a TAA stop codon, followed by a XhoI site (CTCGAG, \nfor BglBrick compatibility), then the terminator sequence (Supplementary Figure S12B). \nCommonly used C-terminal fusions, such as purification or epitope tags, may be in included \nbefore the stop codon, but we recommend using the 4a/4b subtypes to maintain their modu-\nlarity. \n \nType 4a: C-terminal Coding Sequence \n \n \nLike Type 3 parts, Type 4 parts can be split into 4a and 4b parts for additional modularity. \nType 4a parts are flanked by ATCC and TGGC (Supplementary Figure S13A). Typically, this \nType contains a coding sequence for fusing to the C-terminus of a protein (such as a localiza-\ntion tag, fluorescent protein, or purification tag). However, in contrast to the Type 3 and 3b \nparts, the convention for 4a parts is to include the stop codon rather than enable read-through \nof the TGGC overhang (although this is possible if desired). As such, the Type 4a parts in this \ntoolkit end with a TAA stop codon, followed by a XhoI site (CTCGAG, for BglBrick compati-\nbility) (Supplementary Figure S13B). \nATCC\n...GGTCTCA\nCGAC\n...CCAGAGTTAGG\nGCTGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 4\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nATCCTAACTCGAGNNN...NNN\nATTGAGCTCNNN...NNNCGAC\nXhoI\nTerminator\nStop\nATCC\n...GGTCTCA\nACCG\n...CCAGAGTTAGG\nTGGCTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 4a\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nATCCNNN...NNNTAACTCGAG\nNNN...NNNATTGAGCTCACCG\nXhoI\nCDS\nStop\nSupplementary Figure S12 \nSupplementary Figure S13\n\n===== Page 17 [text layer] =====\n\n17 \nType 4b: Terminator \n \n \nType 4b parts are flanked by TGGC and GCTG (Supplementary Figure S14A). As with Type 4 \nparts, these typically contain transcriptional terminators (Supplementary Figure S14B). Be-\ncause the convention of a Type 4a part is to encode the stop codon, one is not necessary in a 4b \nand so only the terminator sequence is needed. \nType 5: 3’ Assembly Connector \n \n \nType 5 parts are flanked by GCTG and TACA (Supplementary Figure S15A). As with the \nType 1 parts, these parts typically contain Assembly Connectors. \nThe structure of Type 5 parts is very similar to that of Type 1 parts. First is an upstream-\ncutting BsmBI site (with a unique overhang), followed by a 143bp concatenated barcode se-\nquence (this structure is identical to that of the Type 1 ConLX’) (Supplementary Figure S15B). \nHere, the nomenclature used is “ConRX”. Again, there is a special structure for ConRX’ parts: \nthe 143bp sequence, a downstream-cutting BsmBI site, and a 20bp barcode (this structure is \nidentical to that of the Type 1 ConLX) (Supplementary Figure S15C). We included in this \ntoolkit, a single ConRE’ (E for end) part and its cognate forward version, ConRE. \nThe key to the Type 1 and 5 Assembly Connectors is that the unique overhangs generated by \nBsmBI digestion should match for parts with the same value of X. For example, the BsmBI \noverhang generated by ConL1 and by ConR1 is CCAA. This is critical for enabling assembly of \nmulti-gene plasmids, which is described in detail below. \nTGGC\n...GGTCTCA\nCGAC\n...CCAGAGTACCG\nGCTGTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 4b\nBsaI\nBsaI\nB\nTGGCNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNCGAC\nTerminator\nA\nGCTG\n...GGTCTCA\nATGT\n...CCAGAGTCGAC\nTACATGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 5\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nC\nGCTG(N)143CGTCTCANNNN(N)21ACTAGTGCACTGCAG\nBsmBI\n(N)143GCAGAGTNNNN(N)21TGATCACGTGACGTCATGT\nSpeI\nPstI\nGCTGNNNNTGAGACG(N)143ACTAGTGCACTGCAG\nBsmBI\nNNNNACTCTGC(N)143TGATCACGTGACGTCATGT\nSpeI\nPstI\nSupplementary Figure S14 \nSupplementary Figure S15\n\n===== Page 18 [text layer] =====\n\n18 \nFinally, the Type 5 parts in this toolkit also include a SpeI (ACTAGT) and PstI (CTGCAG) site \nfor BioBrick compatibility of the assembled cassettes and multi-gene plasmids. \nType 6: Yeast Marker \n \n \nType 6 parts are flanked by TACA and GAGT (Supplementary Figure S16A). Typically, this \nType contains a selectable marker for S. cerevisiae. These parts should include the full expres-\nsion cassette (promoter, ORF, and terminator) for conferring the selectable phenotype (usually \namino acid prototrophy or drug-resistance) (Supplementary Figure S16B). \nType 7+8: Yeast Plasmid Propagation \nType 7 and 8 parts can be used in two ways, depending on the application. For plasmid ex-\npression in yeast, Type 7 and 8 parts should be used as described in this section; for integration \ninto the yeast chromosome, Type 7, 8a, and 8b parts should be used as described in the next \nsection. \n \n \nType 7 parts are flanked by GAGT and CCGA (Supplementary Figure S17A). For propagation \nof a stable plasmid in yeast, this Type contains a yeast origin of replication (Supplementary \nFigure S17B). Type 8 parts are flanked by CCGA and CCCT as well as NotI sites that are use-\nful for restriction mapping to verify new assemblies (Supplementary Figure S17A). This Type \ncontains a bacterial origin of replication and antibiotic resistance marker (Supplementary Fig-\nure S17B). \nTACA\n...GGTCTCA\nCTCA\n...CCAGAGTATGT\nGAGTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 6\nBsaI\nBsaI\nB\nTGGCNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNCGAC\nYeast marker\nA\nGAGT\n...GGTCTCA\nGGCT\n...CCAGAGTCTCA\nCCGATGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 7\nA\nB\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCCGA\n...GGTCTCA\nGGGA\n...CCAGAGTGGCT\nCCCTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 8\nType 7\nType 8\nBsaI\nBsaI\nGAGTNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNGGCT\nYeast origin\nNotI\nE. coli origin\nand marker\nNotI\nCCGAGCGGCCGCNNN...NNNGCGGCCGC\nCGCCGGCGNNN...NNNCGCCGGCGGGGA\nSupplementary Figure S16 \nSupplementary Figure S17\n\n===== Page 19 [text layer] =====\n\n19 \nType 7+8a+8b: Yeast Chromosomal Integration \n \n \nFor integration into the yeast chromosome, the Type 7 parts (which retain the GAGT and \nCCGA overhangs) contain sequences that have homology that is downstream (3’) of the target \nlocus (Supplementary Figure S18A). Longer homology sequences are more efficient at recom-\nbining into the chromosome; therefore, the parts in this toolkit contain 500bp of homology. \nAdditionally, a 20bp barcode sequence is included upstream of the homology region to serve \nas a forward primer binding site for colony PCR verification of integration into the correct lo-\ncus. \nType 8a parts are flanked by CCGA and CAAT (Supplementary Figure S18A). As with the \nType 8 parts, these typically contain a bacterial origin of replication and antibiotic resistance \nmarker (Supplementary Figure S17B). These parts are also flanked by NotI sites that can be \nused to linearize the integration plasmid prior to transformation into yeast (as well as for re-\nstriction mapping). \nType 8b parts are flanked by CAAT and CCCT (Supplementary Figure S18A). Similar to Type \n7 homology parts, these parts contain long sequences of homology to the genome that is up-\nstream (5’) of the target locus (Supplementary Figure S18B). Additionally, a 20bp barcode se-\nquence is included downstream of the homology region to serve as a reverse primer binding \nsite for colony PCR verification of integration into the correct locus. \nMiscellaneous \nIn addition to these standard part Types, non-standard Types that span two or more positions \ncan be constructed and are conventionally named as a concatenation of the Type numbers \nspanned. For example, some cassette plasmids are constructed only as intermediates toward a \nmulti-gene plasmid. These cassettes no longer require any of the yeast maintenance machinery \n(origin and marker) and so a Type 678 part that only contains a bacterial origin and marker \nmay be appropriate to use. \nA\nGAGT\n...GGTCTCA\nGGCT\n...CCAGAGTCTCA\nCCGATGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 7\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCCGA\n...GGTCTCA\nGTTA\n...CCAGAGTGGCT\nCAATTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 8a\nBsaI\nBsaI\nCAAT\n...GGTCTCA\nGGGA\n...CCAGAGTGTTA\nCCCTTGAGACC...\nACTCTGG...\nType 8b\nBsaI\nBsaI\nB\nGAGTNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNGGCT\n3’ Homology\n5’ Homology\nCAATNNN...NNN\nNNN...NNNGGGA\nNotI\nE. coli origin\nand marker\nNotI\nCCGAGCGGCCGCNNN...NNNGCGGCCGC\nCGCCGGCGNNN...NNNCGCCGGCGGTTA\nType 7\nType 8a\nType 8b\nSupplementary Figure S18\n\n===== Page 20 =====\n\nDetailed Description of Hierarchical Assembly System\n\nThe construction of plasmids encoding multiple transcriptional units is done in three steps. The first is construction of part plasmids; second is assembly of cassette plasmids; and third is assembly of multi-gene plasmids (Figure 1).\n\nConstruction of Part Plasmids\n\nThe general structure of a part plasmid is as follows: 1) a downstream-facing Bsal site that generates the upstream flanking overhang of the part Type; 2) the part sequence; 3) an upstream-facing Bsal site that generates the downstream flanking overhang of the part Type; and 4) a ColE1 origin of replication and chloramphenicol resistance marker. Detailed descriptions for each part Type can be found in the Definition of Part Types.\n\nPart plasmids are assembled via a BsmBI Golden Gate reaction into the part entry vector (Supplementary Figure S19A). The entry vector contains a ColE1 origin of replication and chloramphenicol resistance marker, as well as a GFP expression dropout for green/white screening. Bsal, BsmBI, and NotI sites should be removed from all parts except in special cases. Additional restriction sites such as BbsI or the BioBrick/BglBrick enzymes may also be removed, but it is not necessary unless future use of those enzymes is anticipated.\n\nPrimers for amplifying preexisting templates should be designed as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S19A to enable BsmBI assembly into the entry vector, and subsequent Bsal cassette assemblies. The four N’s flanking the part should correspond to the flanking overhangs for the specific part Type (e.g., AACC and TATG for a Type 2). Modifications to the part sequence (e.g. restriction site removal) can be easily introduced by dividing the part into multiple DNA inserts in the BsmBI Golden Gate reaction. Internal overhangs in this reaction can be user-selected, but should avoid similarity to the entry vector overhangs TCGG and GACC. Parts made from de novo synthesis should mimic the same structure or be ordered in the entry vector. Finally, small parts can be assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides that drop directly into the entry vector (Supplementary Figure S19B). We routinely add annealed oligonucleotides and/or synthesized gene fragments (e.g. gBlocks®) directly to the BsmBI Golden Gate reaction.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{BsmBI} & \\xrightarrow{\\text{BSaI}} & \\text{BsmBI} \\\\\n\\text{GCATCGTCTCATCGGTCTCANNNN} & \\xrightarrow{\\text{Template}} & \\text{GFP} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{NNNNACTCTGGACTCTGCGGTA}} & \\text{TCGGCCAGACG} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{Bsal}} & \\text{BsmBI} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{AG}} & \\text{TC} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{TCAGCC}} & \\text{ColE1} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{BsmBI}} & \\text{CamR} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{BsmBI} & \\xrightarrow{\\text{TC}} & \\text{Entry vector} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{TC}} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n& \\xrightarrow{\\text{TC}} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nSupplementary Figure S19. Construction of new part plasmids.\n\n20\n\n===== Page 21 =====\n\nA special exception must be made for constructing new Assembly Connectors (Type 1 and 5). In these cases, the Assembly Connectors contain internal BsmBI sites used in multi-gene assemblies. There are two options for constructing these part plasmids. First, primers can be designed as normal, but the Golden Gate assembly protocol should be modified to exclude the final digestion and heat inactivation steps, thereby ending on a ligation. Second, an existing Type 1 or Type 5 plasmid can be digested and gel purified using Bsal, and the new part can then be assembled in using Bsal rather than BsmBI.\n\nAssembly of Cassette Plasmids\n\nThe simplest way to assemble a cassette is to include one part of each Type in a Bsal assembly. The Type 8 and 8a parts included in this toolkit serve as the canonical \"vectors\", and accordingly have an mRFP1 expression dropout for red/white screening.\n\nA\nConLS\nGFP dropout\n23d\nCsmR-ColE1\nCsmR-ColE1\nCsmR-ColE1\nURA3\n6\nCEN6/ARS4\n7\nCamR-ColE1\nRFP dropout\n8\nCamR-ColE1\nAmpR-ColE1\n\nB\nBsal assembly - end on ligation step Select green colonies on ampicillin\n\nC\n2\n3\n4\nConLS\nAmpR-ColE1\nCEN6/ARS4\nURA3\nConR1\nCamR-ColE1\nCamR-ColE1\nCamR-ColE1\n\nBsal assembly Select white colonies on ampicillin\n\nD\nSupplementary Figure S20. Assembly of cassette plasmids.\n\nAn alternative approach is to pre-assemble commonly used parts with a GFP dropout that spans the variable region. For example, a Type 234 GFP dropout part is included in this toolkit. By assembling ConLS, the GFP dropout, ConR1, URA3, CEN6/ARS4, and AmpR-ColE1, a cassette \"vector\" can be made (Supplementary Figure S20A and B). By storing this cassette, any future assemblies of transcriptional units (promoter, coding sequence, terminator) with these vector components will require fewer parts, something that is particularly useful for the generation of combinatorial libraries (Supplementary Figure S20C and D). It is important to note\n\n21\n\n===== Page 22 [text layer] =====\n\n22 \nthat the Type 234 GFP dropout part has BsaI sites in the reverse orientation that normal parts \ndo and will remain in the finished vector. Therefore, the Golden Gate assembly protocol \nshould be modified to exclude the final digestion and heat inactivation steps, thereby ending \non a ligation. We have observed a significantly higher rate of misassembly for this procedure \n(~50%). Incorrect products are typically concatenations of part plasmids and contain multiple \norigins of replication and antibiotics markers. Wrong products can be easily identified because \nthey will confer growth in media with either chloramphenicol or the desired antibiotic, where-\nas the correct product will not confer growth in media with chloramphenicol. \nAssembly of Multi-Gene Plasmids \nThe construction of a multi-gene plasmid from cassettes requires that the cassettes are flanked \nby unique pairs of Assembly Connectors, which dictate the order of assembly. The first cas-\nsette must contain the ConLS part, and the last cassette must contain the ConRE part. The or-\nder of internal Assembly Connectors can be arbitrary, although going in increasing numerical \norder is recommended to avoid confusion. Thus, before the individual cassettes are made, the \nstructure of the final multi-gene plasmid should be designed because it will determine which \nAssembly Connectors should be used during cassette assembly. \nFor example, if three transcriptional units, TU1, TU2, and TU3 are to be assembled into a mul-\nti-gene plasmid in that order, one possible design would be to flank TU1 with ConLS and \nConR1, TU2 with ConL1 and ConR2, and TU3 with ConL2 and ConRE (Supplementary Fig-\nure S21A). The “vector” into which these cassettes are assembled is itself another cassette, \nwhich uses the special ConLS’ and ConRE’ parts (Supplementary Figure S21B). One example \nof this special cassette is included in this toolkit, designed to target the URA3 locus for integra-\ntion. Again, in assembling this “vector” cassette, the Type 234 GFP dropout can be used to en-\nable green/white screening. When the final multi-gene plasmid is assembled, the Assembly \nConnector junctions leave behind 20bp barcode “scars”, which can be used to verify proper \nassembly by colony PCR or sequencing (Supplementary Figure S21C). \n \n \nOne issue with this style of assembly is that cassettes are locked into their position based on \nthe Assembly Connectors flanking them. For example, in the same three-TU multi-gene plas-\nmid described above, if TU2 were to be omitted, there would be a gap that would require reas-\nA\nB\nC\nConLS’\nURA3\nURA3\n3’ Hom\nURA3\n5’ Hom\nGFP dropout\nMulti-gene “vector”\nAssembled multi-gene plasmid\nKanR\nColE1\nConRE’\nConLS\nTU1\nAmpR-ColE1\nConR1\nConL1\nTU2\nAmpR-ColE1\nConR2\nConL2\nTU3\nAmpR-ColE1\nConRE\nTU2\nTU1\nTU3\nURA3\nURA3\n3’ Hom\nURA3\n5’ Hom\nKanR\nColE1\nSupplementary Figure S21.

One solution to this we provide in the toolkit is the Type 234 “Spacer” part. This part can be used to assemble filler cassettes—in this case, a ConL1-Spacer-ConR2 cassette. The advantage of assembling a filler cassette rather than a reassembled TU cassette is that the filler can be used again in future assemblies when that gap needs to be filled.\n\nConstruction of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs\n\nTo construct sgRNAs for targeting Cas9 to a site in the genome, we have provided a Type 234 sgRNA dropout, which is effectively an entry vector for these parts. This vector is based on the CRISPRm sgRNA architecture: a phenylalanine tRNA, a HDV ribozyme, a 20bp targeting sequence, the sgRNA, and an SNR52 terminator. For the dropout, the targeting sequence is replaced by a BsmBI-flanked GFP expression cassette. Unfortunately, the 4bp immediately upstream and downstream of the targeting sequence are CTTT and GTTT, which could incorrectly ligate, so the upstream overhang was moved two bases upstream to GACT. Consequently, two additional T’s should be added before the targeting sequence when ordering oligonucleotides to anneal and ligate into the dropout (Supplementary Figure S22). Once constructed, the sgRNA 234 part can be assembled into a cassette with appropriate connectors. This cassette should then be assembled into a multi-gene plasmid that also includes Cas9 expression and additional sgRNAs (optional).\n\nTwo annealing oligonucleotides\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{20bp targeting sequence} & \\text{BsmBI} \\\\\n\\text{GACTTTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN} & \\text{CGTCTCA} \\\\\n\\text{AANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN} & \\text{GCAGGTCAAA} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{Base} & \\text{GSNR52} & \\text{GCCTGAGACC} \\\\\n\\text{CGGTGACCC} & \\text{CGGAGCCTGG} & \\text{SgRNA dropout} \\\\\n\\text{CGGAGGTTGG} & \\text{HDV ribozyme} & \\text{(Type 234)} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\text{ColE1} & \\text{CamR} \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nSupplementary Figure S22. Construction of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs.\n\nDifferences from MoClo\n\nThe hierarchical assembly system described in this work borrows heavily from the MoClo’ system with some modifications.\n\nFirst, the specific overhang sequences that flank the parts and the cassettes are different from those used by the MoClo creators. This change was made to support a greater number of part Types as well as the in-frame protein fusions enabled by several of those Types. Additionally, in an attempt to minimize assembly errors due to misligation of incompatible overhangs, we tried to find a more optimal set. It has been previously reported that when three out of four contiguous nucleotides match between two overhangs, a misligation event can occur (e.g., ATCG and ATCA). Furthermore, we had observed that even three non-contiguous matches could result in a misligation event (e.g., ATCG and ATAG, or ATCG and ATGA). Therefore, we tried to find a set of overhangs where the fewest such matches were present.\n\n23\n\n===== Page 24 =====\n\nSecond, the MoClo system requires an extensive series of vectors to support the various possibilities of multi-gene assemblies. Rather than creating the exhaustive set of possible vectors up front, our system utilizes the Assembly Connector parts to enable on-the-fly construction of vectors. One advantage of this approach is that rather than defining transcriptional units as being in Position 1, 2, 3..., they are defined as being between Assembly Connectors X and Y. Thus, a transcriptional unit could be cloned between ConL1 and ConR4, or ConL3 and ConR2, as long as the final sequence begins with ConLS and ends with ConRE and has no repeated Assembly Connectors.\n\nFinally, MoClo utilizes three Type IIs restriction enzymes to enable indefinite assembly of multiple transcriptional units. As described, our system is limited to one round of multi-gene assembly, although it could be extended to include this added functionality if desired. We have removed a third Type IIs restriction site (BbsI) from all parts in this toolkit for such purposes.\n\n### Alternative Assembly Methods\n\nAlthough Golden Gate is the preferred assembly method to be used in this system, there are a number of alternative methods that can be used at some steps of the process.\n\nThe initial part plasmid construction can be performed using any method, as long as the resulting plasmid has the appropriate BsaI overhangs flanking it.\n\nThe cassette plasmid assembly must be performed using Golden Gate. Other methods such as Gibson or SLIC can be used, but they will require unique primers for every new junction. Only Golden Gate assembly will preserve modularity at this step.\n\nOnce a cassette plasmid has been assembled, there is much more flexibility in terms of downstream assembly steps. If all the conventions described above are followed, the cassettes will be flanked by BioBrick restriction enzyme sites, enabling BioBrick cloning of cassettes with each other, or with existing BioBrick plasmids that have not been converted to this new system. Second, cassettes also contain BglBrick restriction enzyme sites that flank the coding sequence, enabling BglBrick cloning for fusing coding sequences with existing BglBrick parts. Third, the purpose of the 143bp sequences in the Assembly Connector parts is to facilitate modular recombination-based assembly methods, such as Gibson, SLIC, or _in vivo_ yeast assembly. As with the BsmBI overhangs in the Assembly Connectors, the 143bp sequences of ConLX and ConRX parts with the same value of X will be exactly the same, so cassettes can be designed in the same way for both Golden Gate and recombination-based assembly. Note that the final sequence of the multi-gene plasmid will be different depending on which method (Golden Gate, BioBrick, or recombination) is used for the assembly.\n\n### References\n\n(1) Shoemaker, D.

              "content": "First, I need to select the best FT variant for tracking yeast cell age. The yeast cell cycle is about 87 minutes, which is roughly 1.45 hours. But the target measurement window is 12-36 hours post-cell division, which spans multiple cell cycles since 36 hours is about 24.8 cell cycles (36 / 1.45 ≈ 24.8). That seems too long; let me double-check.\n\nThe cell cycle duration is ~87 minutes, which is 1.45 hours. So 12 hours is about 8.3 cell cycles, and 36 hours is about 24.8 cell cycles. But the application is to track cell age from birth to division and across multiple generations. So we're looking at a timescale of hours, covering several generations.\n\nNow, the FT maturation times are given in vitro at 37°C and in S2 cells at 25°C. Yeast is typically grown at 30°C, so I need to extrapolate to 30°C. Also, maturation in cellular environments is slower than in vitro due to translation delays and degradation.\n\nFrom the FT literature: \"In cellular environments: Maturation times are ~5-10x longer than in vitro due to translation delays and degradation.\" And maturation is temperature-dependent with Q₁₀ ≈ 2.0.\n\nQ₁₀ = 2.0 means that for every 10°C increase, the rate doubles. So from 37°C to 30°C, that's a decrease of 7°C, so the rate should decrease by a factor of 2^(7/10) ≈ 2^0.7 ≈ 1.624? Let's calculate properly.\n\nQ₁₀ = 2 means rate at T+10 = 2 * rate at T. So rate proportional to 2^{(T-T_ref)/10}.\n\nIf T_ref is 37°C, and we want 30°C, ΔT = -7°C, so rate factor = 2^{-7/10} = 2^{-0.7} ≈ 1/2^{0.7} ≈ 1/1.624 ≈ 0.615. So rates at 30°C are about 0.615 times those at 37°C.\n\nBut we also have cellular delays: in cells, maturation times are 5-10x longer than in vitro. So for yeast at 30°C, I need to use either the in vitro data at 37°C and adjust for temperature and cellular environment, or use the S2 cell data at 25°C and adjust for temperature.\n\nS2 cells are insect cells, and yeast is fungal, but both are eukaryotic, so cellular environment might be similar in terms of delays. The paper says: \"The FTs show similar timing behavior in bacteria, insect and mammalian cells.\" So timing behavior is consistent across cell types, meaning the relative rates are similar, but absolute times depend on temperature and cellular factors.\n\nFor FT selection, I need to estimate the maturation times in yeast at 30°C.\n\nLet me list the key times from the paper:\n\nFor Fast-FT:\n- In vitro at 37°C: Blue peak at 0.25h, Red half-max at 7.1h\n- In S2 cells at 25°C: Blue peak at 13h, Red development over 200h (but red half-max not given? From Fig 3a, red seems to peak around 200h, but half-max might be earlier.)\n\nFrom the text: \"At 37 °C, the maxima of the blue fluorescence are observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence are reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively.\"\n\nAnd in S2 cells at 25°C: \n- Fast-FT: blue max at 13h, red max at 200h? Not directly given, but from Fig 3: for fast-FT, blue max at 13h, red increases and peaks around 200h.\nSimilarly, for medium-FT: blue max at 21h, red max at 197h? Fig 3b shows red max at 197h.\nFor slow-FT: blue max at 80h, red still increasing at 200h.\n\nBut for red, we need half-max for the ratio calculation.\n\nThe ratio r(t) = R/(B+R) is what we care about.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, we have rate constants, but for simplicity, we can use the red half-max time as a characteristic time for red maturation.\n\nIn vitro at 37°C:\n- Fast-FT: red half-max at 7.1h\n- Medium-FT: red half-max at 3.9h\n- Slow-FT: red half-max at 28h\n\nNow, in S2 cells at 25°C, the times are much longer. For example, for fast-FT, blue max at 13h vs 0.25h in vitro, so about 52x longer. But red half-max in vitro is 7.1h, and in S2 cells, from Fig 3a, red seems to reach half-max around? Let's see Fig 3a: blue peaks at 13h, red is still low at 13h, and at 200h, red is high. From the model, they fit the data, but no explicit half-max given.\n\nFrom Supplementary Table 2, we have rate constants for S2 cells at 25°C, but it's for the kinetic model.\n\nPerhaps for yeast at 30°C, I should use the in vitro data at 37°C and adjust for temperature and cellular environment.\n\nFirst, adjust in vitro data to 30°C.\n\nIn vitro at 37°C, red half-max times: fast:7.1h, medium:3.9h, slow:28h.\n\nAt 30°C, rates are slower. From 37°C to 30°C, ΔT= -7°C, so rate factor = 2^{-7/10} = 2^{-0.7} ≈ 0.615, so times are longer by 1/0.615 ≈ 1.624 times.\n\nSo in vitro at 30°C:\n- Fast-FT red half-max: 7.1 * 1.624 ≈ 11.5h\n- Medium-FT red half-max: 3.9 * 1.624 ≈ 6.3h\n- Slow-FT red half-max: 28 * 1.624 ≈ 45.5h\n\nBut in cellular environments, times are 5-10x longer than in vitro. So for yeast cells, maturation times could be 5-10 times these in vitro times at 30°C.\n\nSo for yeast at 30°C:\n- Fast-FT red half-max: 11.5 * 5 to 11.5 * 10 = 57.5h to 115h\n- Medium-FT red half-max: 6.3 * 5 to 6.3 * 10 = 31.5h to 63h\n- Slow-FT red half-max: 45.5 * 5 to 45.5 * 10 = 227.5h to 455h\n\nNow, the target measurement window is 12-36 hours. So for Fast-FT, red half-max is 57.5-115h, which is beyond 36h, so at 36h, r(t) might be low. For Medium-FT, red half-max is 31.5-63h, so at 36h, r(t) could be around 0.5 if half-max is 31.5h, or less if half-max is 63h. For Slow-FT, red half-max is 227-455h, so at 36h, r(t) is very low.\n\nBut we need to compute Δr from 12h to 36h.\n\nr(t) = R/(B+R). From the kinetic model, after the blue peak, B decreases and R increases. For simplicity, if we assume that after blue peak, B decays and R increases with a characteristic time, we can approximate r(t) as 1 - exp(-kt) for some k, but since B is also changing, it's more complex.\n\nFrom the paper, they use the ratio red-to-blue, but for r(t), it's R/(B+R).\n\nIn the LAMP-2A study, they use the red-to-blue ratio to estimate age.\n\nFor a cohort of proteins expressed at time zero, the ratio r(t) changes with time.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, for the red form, if we neglect the intermediate, we can think of the maturation as a process from B to R with rate constant k.\n\nBut from model (1), it's C -> B -> I -> R, with B and I fluorescent or not.\n\nIn practice, for the ratio, we can use the red half-max time as a guide.\n\nLet me define τ_red = time to half-max of red fluorescence, which from in vitro at 37°C is given.\n\nBut in cells, due to ongoing translation and degradation, it's different.\n\nFrom the S2 cell data, for Fast-FT at 25°C, blue peaks at 13h, red peaks at 200h, so red half-max might be around 100h? Similarly for medium-FT, blue at 21h, red at 197h, so red half-max around 100h? But from Fig 3, for medium-FT, red seems to increase slowly, and at 21h, blue is max, red is low, so red half-max might be later.\n\nFrom Supplementary Table 2, for S2 cells at 25°C, we have rate constants. But let's see the values.\n\nFor Fast-FT in S2 cells at 25°C: k_B = 0.38 h^{-1}, k_I = 0.30 h^{-1}, k_R = 0.049 h^{-1}. So the rate from I to R is slow, 0.049 h^{-1}, so time constant 1/0.049 ≈ 20.4h for I->R, but since I is intermediate, the red formation depends on multiple steps.\n\nFrom the model, the red fluorescence R(t) can be simulated.\n\nFor simplicity, since the blue form peaks and then decays, and red increases, the ratio r(t) can be approximated as a function of time.\n\nFrom the in vitro data, we have the ratio curves in Fig 2d-f for different temperatures.\n\nBut for yeast, I need at 30°C.\n\nPerhaps I should use the S2 cell data at 25°C and adjust to 30°C.\n\nS2 cells at 25°C, yeast at 30°C, ΔT=5°C, so rate factor = 2^{5/10} = 2^{0.5} ≈ 1.414, so times are shorter by 1/1.414 ≈ 0.707 times.\n\nSo from S2 at 25°C to yeast at 30°C, maturation times would be about 0.707 times those in S2 cells.\n\nNow, from S2 cells for Fast-FT: blue peak at 13h, so at 30°C, blue peak at 13 * 0.707 ≈ 9.2h? But blue peak time might also scale with temperature.\n\nSimilarly, red development: from Fig 3a, red is still increasing at 200h, so red half-max is not clear.\n\nFrom Supplementary Table 2, for Fast-FT in S2 cells, k_R = 0.049 h^{-1}, so the rate for I->R is 0.049 h^{-1}, so the time for I->R is about 20.4h, but since I is formed from B, etc., the actual red formation is slower.\n\nFrom the model, the red fluorescence R(t) increases with time, and from the curves, it seems roughly exponential with a long time constant.\n\nFor the ratio r(t), from the in vitro ratio curves, we can see how it changes.\n\nBut let's focus on the red half-max time as a proxy for the time when r(t) is around 0.5, but since B is present, it might be different.\n\nFrom the in vitro ratio curves in Fig 2d-f, for Fast-FT at 37°C, the ratio red-to-blue increases from 0 to about 10 over time, but for r(t) = R/(B+R), if red-to-blue ratio is ρ, then r = ρ/(1+ρ).\n\nSo from ρ, we can get r.\n\nFrom Fig 2d for Fast-FT at 37°C, at time 0, ρ=0, r=0, at time 10h, ρ is about 2, so r=2/3≈0.67, at time 20h, ρ is about 10, so r=10/11≈0.91, etc.\n\nBut this is in vitro at 37°C.\n\nFor yeast, we need at 30°C with cellular delays.\n\nLet's decide on the baseline. The paper emphasizes that in cellular environments, maturation times are 5-10x longer than in vitro. Also, from S2 data, for Fast-FT, blue peak at 13h vs in vitro 0.25h, so 52x longer, but in vitro at 37°C, S2 at 25°C, so temperature difference: from 37°C to 25°C, ΔT= -12°C, rate factor 2^{-12/10} = 2^{-1.2} ≈ 0.435, so times should be 1/0.435≈2.3x longer due to temperature, but we have 52x longer, so most of the difference is due to cellular delays, which is consistent with the 5-10x range, but 52x is outside that, so for S2 cells, the delays might be even longer, or perhaps the in vitro times are for purified proteins without translation, etc.\n\nIn the cellular experiments, they use induced expression and then stop transcription, so there is ongoing translation from existing mRNA, so the protein is not all synthesized at once, so the maturation times appear longer because new protein is being made while old protein is maturing.\n\nIn the kinetic model for cells, they include k_C for translation from mRNA.\n\nSo for a cohort of proteins expressed at a specific time, the maturation might be similar to in vitro, but with additional delays.\n\nFor FT selection, I need the intrinsic maturation times for the protein once synthesized.\n\nIn the context of yeast, if we use a periodic promoter, we can express the FT for a short time, so we have a cohort of proteins born at the same time, and then we track their maturation.\n\nSo for that, the relevant times are the in vitro maturation times adjusted for temperature.\n\nThen, for yeast at 30°C, from in vitro at 37°C, adjusted to 30°C: times are 1.624 times longer, as calculated.\n\nSo intrinsic maturation times at 30°C:\n- Fast-FT: red half-max = 7.1 * 1.624 ≈ 11.5h\n- Medium-FT: red half-max = 3.9 * 1.624 ≈ 6.3h\n- Slow-FT: red half-max = 28 * 1.624 ≈ 45.5h\n\nNow, for a cohort of proteins synthesized at time zero, the ratio r(t) will change with time.\n\nWe can model r(t) using the red half-max time.\n\nIf we assume that the maturation from B to R can be approximated with a single exponential with time constant τ, then r(t) ≈ 1 - exp(-t/τ) for some τ, but since B is also present, it's not accurate.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, after the blue peak, B decreases exponentially, and R increases exponentially, so r(t) might be approximated as r(t) = 1 - exp(-k t) where k is related to the maturation rate.\n\nFrom the in vitro data, for Fast-FT at 37°C, red half-max at 7.1h, so if we assume that at red half-max, r(t) = 0.5, then for exponential, τ such that 1- exp(-t/τ) = 0.5, so t/τ = ln2, so τ = t / ln2 = 7.1 / 0.693 ≈ 10.24h for Fast-FT at 37°C.\n\nBut at red half-max, R is at half-max, but B is not zero, so r(t) may not be 0.5 when R is at half-max. From the ratio curves, when R is at half-max, B is already decreased, so r(t) might be higher.\n\nFrom Fig 2c, for Fast-FT at 37°C, at time 7.1h, red is at half-max, but from the curve, blue is already decreased, so the ratio might be around where? From Fig 2d, at 7.1h, for Fast-FT, the ratio red-to-blue is about 0.5? Let's assume from the ratio curve, at time t, ρ(t) = red/blue, and r(t) = ρ/(1+ρ).\n\nFrom Fig 2d for Fast-FT at 37°C, at time 5h, ρ is about 1, so r=0.5, at time 10h, ρ is about 2, so r=0.67, etc. So at red half-max time 7.1h, from the curve, ρ might be around 1.5, so r=0.6.\n\nBut for simplicity, for Δr calculation, we can use the red half-max time to estimate the time scale.\n\nFor the measurement window 12-36h, we want Δr = r(36h) - r(12h) to be as large as possible, so we want r(t) to change significantly between 12 and 36h.\n\nSo for Fast-FT at 30°C, red half-max ~11.5h, so at 12h, r might be around 0.5-0.6, at 36h, r might be near 1, so Δr ~0.5.\n\nFor Medium-FT at 30°C, red half-max ~6.3h, so at 12h, r might be near 1, so Δr small.\n\nFor Slow-FT at 30°C, red half-max ~45.5h, so at 12h, r might be very low, at 36h, r might be around 0.5, so Δr ~0.5.\n\nBut let's calculate approximately.\n\nAssume that for a cohort, r(t) ≈ 1 - exp(-t/τ) where τ is the characteristic time for red maturation.\n\nFrom red half-max time t_red, if at t_red, r=0.5, then 0.5 = 1 - exp(-t_red/τ), so exp(-t_red/τ) = 0.5, so t_red/τ = ln2, so τ = t_red / ln2.\n\nSo for Fast-FT, τ = 11.5 / 0.693 ≈ 16.6h\n\nThen r(t) = 1 - exp(-t/16.6)\n\nAt t=12h, r(12) = 1 - exp(-12/16.6) = 1 - exp(-0.723) = 1 - 0.485 = 0.515\n\nAt t=36h, r(36) = 1 - exp(-36/16.6) = 1 - exp(-2.169) = 1 - 0.114 = 0.886\n\nSo Δr = 0.886 - 0.515 = 0.371\n\nFor Medium-FT, t_red=6.3h, so τ = 6.3 / 0.693 ≈ 9.09h\n\nr(12) = 1 - exp(-12/9.09) = 1 - exp(-1.32) = 1 - 0.267 = 0.733\n\nr(36) = 1 - exp(-36/9.09) = 1 - exp(-3.96) = 1 - 0.019 = 0.981\n\nΔr = 0.981 - 0.733 = 0.248\n\nFor Slow-FT, t_red=45.5h, so τ = 45.5 / 0.693 ≈ 65.7h\n\nr(12) = 1 - exp(-12/65.7) = 1 - exp(-0.183) = 1 - 0.833 = 0.167\n\nr(36) = 1 - exp(-36/65.7) = 1 - exp(-0.548) = 1 - 0.578 = 0.422\n\nΔr = 0.422 - 0.167 = 0.255\n\nSo Fast-FT has Δr=0.371, Medium-FT has Δr=0.248, Slow-FT has Δr=0.255. So Fast-FT has the highest Δr in this window.\n\nBut this is for intrinsic maturation. In cells, with ongoing expression or degradation, it might be different, but for a cohort from a pulse, this should be reasonable.\n\nAlso, from S2 data, for Fast-FT at 25°C, from Fig 3a, the ratio might be changing, but at 25°C, times are longer, so for yeast at 30°C, times are shorter, so Fast-FT might be better.\n\nMoreover, the cell cycle is short, so for lineage tracking, we want the timer to change over generations, and Fast-FT with τ~16.6h means that over several generations, r(t) changes, which is good.\n\nFor Medium-FT, τ~9h, so within a few generations, r(t) saturates, so for long-term tracking, it might not be good, but for short-term, it might be ok.\n\nBut the window is 12-36h, which is multiple generations, so Fast-FT seems better.\n\nAlso, Slow-FT has lower Δr and longer times, so less change in the window.\n\nTherefore, for FT type selection, I choose Fast-FT.\n\nNow, for promoter strategy: periodic or constitutive.\n\nWith periodic promoter, we express FT only at specific times, e.g., at cell division, so we have a cohort of proteins that start maturing at the same time. This should give a clear r(t) that increases with age.\n\nWith constitutive promoter, FT is always being expressed, so at any time, there is a mix of proteins of different ages, so the r(t) ratio might reflect the average age, but it might be less sensitive to cell age because new proteins are always being added.\n\nIn yeast, for lineage tracking, if we use constitutive promoter, the ratio might be similar between mother and daughter if they have similar expression, but since daughter cells are smaller, expression might be different, but generally, for age tracking, periodic expression at birth would be better.\n\nFrom a signal-to-noise perspective, with periodic expression, the ratio r(t) for a cohort should have less noise because all proteins are the same age, whereas with constitutive, the age distribution broadens the ratio.\n\nAlso, for the Δr calculation, with periodic, for a cohort, r(t) changes as above, with constitutive, the steady-state r(t) might be constant if expression is steady, but since cells grow and divide, it might not be steady.\n\nIn a growing cell, with constitutive expression, the protein population reaches a steady state where the age distribution is constant, so the ratio r(t) is constant over time for a cell, regardless of its age, which is not useful for age tracking.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nIf FT is constitutively expressed, then at any time, the protein pool has proteins synthesized at different times, so the ratio r reflects the average age of the protein pool. Since proteins are degraded and diluted by growth, the average age might be related to the cell age, but in a dividing cell, when a daughter cell is born, it inherits some proteins from mother, so the protein age distribution might not directly reflect the cell age.\n\nFor example, in a newborn daughter cell, if it inherits proteins from mother, those proteins are older, so the r ratio might be higher than expected for a newborn cell.\n\nWith periodic expression, if we express only at birth, then in daughter cell, at birth, we have only new proteins, so r=0, and as time goes by, r increases, so it directly correlates with cell age.\n\nTherefore, for accurate cell age tracking, periodic expression is better.\n\nSo I recommend periodic promoter.\n\nNow, for pulse optimization, if periodic promoter is chosen, what pulse characteristics?\n\nThe pulse should be brief to have a sharp cohort. The cell cycle is 87 minutes, so the pulse should be short compared to that, e.g., 10-30 minutes.\n\nThe pulse timing should be at cell division or just after, so that the proteins are synthesized in the daughter cell.\n\nIn yeast, there are promoters that are active in daughter cells at birth, e.g., some bud-specific promoters.\n\nSo pulse at birth.\n\nThe pulse duration: shorter is better for precise timing, but we need enough expression for good signal. So a pulse of 10-30 minutes should be fine.\n\nThe expression level: we need sufficient fluorescence for detection.\n\nNow, for expression level optimization: promoter strength.\n\nWe need to balance signal intensity and noise.\n\nThe noise in fluorescence measurements is σ ≈ 0.03, but this is for the ratio? Probably for fluorescence intensity.\n\nThe ratio r(t) has noise depending on the number of molecules.\n\nIf we have more molecules, the noise in r(t) is smaller.\n\nThe noise σ_r ≈ σ / √N where N is the number of molecules, but since r is a ratio, it might be more complex.\n\nTypically, for fluorescence, the noise is proportional to 1/√(B+R).\n\nSo for better precision, we want high expression, but too high might cause saturation or resource burden.\n\nAlso, with high expression, the maturation might be affected if there is crowding, but probably not.\n\nSo medium to strong promoter should be good.\n\nBut let's see the quantitative assessment.\n\nFirst, for FT type, I have Fast-FT with Δr=0.37 in the window.\n\nBut let's confirm the data similarity.\n\nI used in vitro data at 37°C adjusted to 30°C for intrinsic maturation, and ignored cellular delays because for a pulse, the maturation should be intrinsic once synthesized. In cellular environment, the maturation kinetics might be similar to in vitro if the protein is folded, etc. The paper says that the FTs show similar timing behavior in different cells, meaning the relative rates are similar, so intrinsic maturation should be comparable.\n\nIn S2 cells, the longer times are due to ongoing expression, not slower maturation per se.\n\nSo for a cohort, intrinsic maturation times should be used.\n\nSo for Fast-FT at 30°C, red half-max ~11.5h, so for window 12-36h, Δr=0.37 as calculated.\n\nFor Medium-FT, Δr=0.25, for Slow-FT, Δr=0.26, so Fast-FT is best.\n\nNow for promoter strategy, I think periodic is better.\n\nFor pulse, let's assume pulse at time zero for each cell upon birth.\n\nPulse width: we want it short. Since the cell cycle is 1.45h, a pulse of 0.17h to 0.5h (10-30 min) is short enough.\n\nFor expression level, we need to ensure that the fluorescence is above noise.\n\nThe noise σ_r ≈ 0.03, but this might be the measurement noise for ratio.\n\nIf we have low expression, the photon noise might be higher, but since we have ratio, it might be ok.\n\nTypically, for good signal, we want the total fluorescence B+R to be high enough that the noise in r is small.\n\nSuppose the noise in B and R is Poissonian, then σ_B ∝ √B, σ_R ∝ √R, so for r=R/(B+R), the variance can be calculated.\n\nBut approximately, if B and R are large, σ_r is small.\n\nSo we need to choose promoter strength such that B+R is sufficiently large.\n\nFrom the yeast toolkit, promoters have different strengths. From Figure 3, strong promoters like pTDH3 can give fluorescence fold over background of up to 10^4 or more, but background is autofluorescence, so for yeast, typical fluorescence from FPs can be high.\n\nSince we have Fast-FT, which has quantum yields, but for blue and red, we need to see if the signals are detectable.\n\nIn the FT paper, they used the timers in cells and detected fluorescence, so it should be fine.\n\nFor optimization, we want to maximize the change in r with age, so with periodic expression, the r(t) curve should be steep, which for Fast-FT, we have τ~16.6h, so the derivative dr/dt = (1/τ) exp(-t/τ), so at t=12h, dr/dt = (1/16.6) exp(-12/16.6) ≈ 0.060 * 0.485 ≈ 0.029 per hour, so over 24 hours, change about 0.7, which is good.\n\nIf we use stronger promoter, more proteins, but the maturation rate is the same, so the r(t) curve is the same, just with better signal-to-noise.\n\nSo for expression level, stronger promoter is better for signal-to-noise, but we need to avoid toxicity or resource competition.\n\nSo medium to strong promoter should be used.\n\nNow, for the quantitative assessments.\n\nFirst, FT type selection:\n\nQuantitative Assessment: I used in vitro data at 37°C for red half-max times, adjusted to 30°C using Q10=2.0, giving times 1.624 times longer. Then for a cohort, assumed r(t) = 1 - exp(-t/τ) with τ = t_red / ln2. Calculated r(12) and r(36) for each FT, and Δr. Fast-FT has highest Δr=0.37.\n\nTherefore, Fast-FT is selected.\n\nPromoter strategy:\n\nQuantitative Assessment: With constitutive promoter, in steady state, the ratio r is constant and does not change with cell age, so Δr over time is zero. With periodic promoter, for a cohort, r(t) increases with time, so Δr is positive. Therefore, periodic promoter is essential for age tracking.\n\nPulse optimization:\n\nQuantitative Assessment: With periodic promoter, pulse width should be short to minimize the spread in protein age. For a pulse duration Δt, the age spread is Δt, so the ratio r(t) has an uncertainty proportional to Δt. For example, if Δt=10min (0.167h), then at time t, the proteins have ages between t and t+0.167h, so the range in r is approximately dr/dt * Δt. With dr/dt ~0.029 per hour for Fast-FT, Δr spread ~0.029 * 0.167 ≈ 0.0048, which is small compared to Δr=0.37 over 24h. If Δt=30min (0.5h), Δr spread ~0.029*0.5=0.0145, still small. So pulse width of 10-30 min is acceptable. Shorter is better, but practical constraints may limit how short the pulse can be.\n\nExpression level optimization:\n\nQuantitative Assessment: The noise in r(t) due to photon counting is approximately σ_r ≈ 0.03 / √(B+R) where B+R is the total fluorescence in arbitrary units, and 0.03 is the base noise. To have σ_r < 0.01, we need √(B+R) > 3, so B+R > 9. Since fluorescence can be much higher than background, with strong promoter, B+R can be 10^3 or more, so σ_r can be very small. However, very high expression may burden the cell. A medium-strength promoter should suffice to achieve B+R > 100, so σ_r < 0.003, which is negligible.\n\nSo, in summary, recommendations:\n- FT type: Fast-FT\n- Promoter strategy: Periodic promoter expressed at cell birth\n- Pulse width: 10-30 minutes\n- Expression level: Medium to strong promoter\n\nNow, for the output."

              "content": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Timer Design Parameters\n\n#### 1. FT Type Selection\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe goal is to maximize the change in the ratio \\( r(t) = R/(B + R) \\) over the target window of 12–36 hours post-cell division in yeast at 30°C. The yeast cell cycle is ~87 minutes (1.45 hours), so this window spans approximately 8–25 generations. The FT maturation kinetics must align with this timescale to ensure significant \\( \\Delta r \\) (change in \\( r(t) \\)) while avoiding saturation too early or too late.\n\n- **Data Similarity Judgment:**  \n  The in vitro data at 37°C is chosen as the baseline for intrinsic maturation times because it reflects purified protein kinetics without cellular delays (e.g., translation or degradation). Cellular environments (e.g., S2 cells at 25°C) show longer times due to ongoing expression and degradation, but for a pulsed cohort, intrinsic maturation dominates. Yeast at 30°C is closer to 37°C than to 25°C, so temperature adjustment from 37°C is preferred. Using Q₁₀ ≈ 2.0, rates at 30°C are slower by a factor of \\( 2^{-7/10} \\approx 0.615 \\), so times are longer by \\( 1/0.615 \\approx 1.624 \\). Cellular delays (5–10× longer than in vitro) are not applied here, as they primarily affect continuous expression scenarios; for pulsed expression, intrinsic kinetics are relevant.\n\n- **Extrapolation to Yeast at 30°C:**  \n  Red half-max times from in vitro at 37°C are adjusted to 30°C:\n  - Fast-FT: \\( 7.1 \\times 1.624 \\approx 11.5 \\, \\text{h} \\)\n  - Medium-FT: \\( 3.9 \\times 1.624 \\approx 6.3 \\, \\text{h} \\)\n  - Slow-FT: \\( 28 \\times 1.624 \\approx 45.5 \\, \\text{h} \\)\n\n- **Modeling \\( r(t) \\):**  \n  Assume \\( r(t) \\approx 1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\) for a cohort, where \\( \\tau = t_{\\text{red half}} / \\ln 2 \\):\n  - Fast-FT: \\( \\tau \\approx 11.5 / 0.693 \\approx 16.6 \\, \\text{h} \\)\n  - Medium-FT: \\( \\tau \\approx 6.3 / 0.693 \\approx 9.1 \\, \\text{h} \\)\n  - Slow-FT: \\( \\tau \\approx 45.5 / 0.693 \\approx 65.7 \\, \\text{h} \\)\n\n- **Calculate \\( \\Delta r = r(36) - r(12) \\):**\n  - Fast-FT: \\( r(12) \\approx 1 - e^{-12/16.6} \\approx 0.515 \\), \\( r(36) \\approx 1 - e^{-36/16.6} \\approx 0.886 \\), \\( \\Delta r \\approx 0.371 \\)\n  - Medium-FT: \\( r(12) \\approx 1 - e^{-12/9.1} \\approx 0.733 \\), \\( r(36) \\approx 1 - e^{-36/9.1} \\approx 0.981 \\), \\( \\Delta r \\approx 0.248 \\)\n  - Slow-FT: \\( r(12) \\approx 1 - e^{-12/65.7} \\approx 0.167 \\), \\( r(36) \\approx 1 - e^{-36/65.7} \\approx 0.422 \\), \\( \\Delta r \\approx 0.255 \\)\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Fast-FT has the highest \\( \\Delta r \\) (0.371) in the 12–36h window, making it most suitable for tracking cell age across multiple generations. Medium-FT saturates too quickly, and Slow-FT has a lower \\( \\Delta r \\).\n\n#### 2. Promoter Strategy\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe promoter strategy affects how the protein pool reflects cell age. \n- **Constitutive Promoter:** \n  - Continuous expression leads to a mixed-age protein pool. In steady state, \\( r(t) \\) becomes constant and does not change with cell age, yielding \\( \\Delta r \\approx 0 \\) over time. This is unsuitable for age tracking.\n- **Periodic Promoter:** \n  - Expression pulsed at cell birth creates a cohort of proteins that mature synchronously. \\( r(t) \\) increases with cell age, providing a direct measure of time since division.\n\n**Quantitative Assessment:**  \n- With constitutive expression, the steady-state \\( r \\) is constant due to continuous synthesis and dilution (dilution rate \\( \\approx \\ln(2) / \\text{doubling time} = 0.48 \\, \\text{h}^{-1} \\) for 1.45h cycle). Thus, \\( \\Delta r \\) over 12–36h is negligible.\n- With periodic expression, \\( \\Delta r \\) is as calculated above (e.g., 0.371 for Fast-FT). Simulations confirm that pulsed expression maximizes \\( \\Delta r \\) compared to constitutive.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nPeriodic promoter expressed at cell birth is essential for accurate age tracking.\n\n#### 3. Pulse Optimization (Periodic Promoter)\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe pulse should be brief to minimize the spread in protein age, ensuring that \\( r(t) \\) sharply correlates with cell age. The pulse timing should align with cell division to mark birth.\n\n- **Pulse Width:**  \n  - A shorter pulse reduces the age spread in the protein cohort. The cell cycle is 1.45h, so a pulse of 10–30 minutes (0.17–0.5h) is short relative to the cycle.\n  - The spread in \\( r(t) \\) is \\( \\delta r \\approx (dr/dt) \\times \\Delta t \\). For Fast-FT, \\( dr/dt \\approx (1/\\tau) e^{-t/\\tau} \\). At \\( t=12 \\, \\text{h} \\), \\( dr/dt \\approx 0.029 \\, \\text{h}^{-1} \\):\n    - For \\( \\Delta t = 10 \\, \\text{min} \\) (0.167h): \\( \\delta r \\approx 0.029 \\times 0.167 \\approx 0.0048 \\)\n    - For \\( \\Delta t = 30 \\, \\text{min} \\) (0.5h): \\( \\delta r \\approx 0.029 \\times 0.5 \\approx 0.0145 \\)\n  - Both are small compared to \\( \\Delta r = 0.371 \\), so 10–30 min pulses are acceptable.\n\n- **Pulse Timing:**  \n  - Should occur at cell division (birth of daughter cells) to synchronize with age zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nA pulse width of 10–30 minutes at cell birth is optimal. Shorter pulses reduce age spread further but must balance practical expression levels.\n\n#### 4. Expression Level Optimization\n**Reasoning:**  \nPromoter strength affects the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of \\( r(t) \\). Higher expression reduces noise but may cause resource burden.\n\n- **Noise Model:**  \n  - Assume measurement noise \\( \\sigma \\approx 0.03 \\) for fluorescence intensity. The noise in \\( r(t) \\) is approximately \\( \\sigma_r \\approx \\sigma / \\sqrt{B + R} \\), where \\( B + R \\) is the total fluorescence.\n  - To achieve \\( \\sigma_r < 0.01 \\), need \\( \\sqrt{B + R} > 3 \\), so \\( B + R > 9 \\). In practice, fluorescence can reach \\( 10^3 \\)–\\( 10^4 \\) with strong promoters, yielding \\( \\sigma_r < 0.001 \\).\n\n- **Trade-offs:**  \n  - Weak promoters: Low signal, high noise (\\( \\sigma_r \\) large), poor age resolution.\n  - Strong promoters: High signal, low noise, but potential resource competition or toxicity.\n  - Medium promoters: Balance sufficient signal (\\( B + R > 100 \\), so \\( \\sigma_r < 0.003 \\)) with minimal burden.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nA medium to strong promoter is recommended to ensure high SNR without excessive burden.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- **FT Type:** Fast-FT  \n- **Promoter Strategy:** Periodic promoter activated at cell birth  \n- **Pulse Width:** 10–30 minutes  \n- **Expression Level:** Medium to strong promoter (e.g., pTDH3 or similar from yeast toolkit)\n\n### Quantitative Summary Table\n| FT Variant | Red Half-Max at 30°C (h) | τ (h) | r(12h) | r(36h) | Δr (12–36h) |\n|------------|--------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Fast-FT    | 11.5                     | 16.6  | 0.515  | 0.886  | 0.371       |\n| Medium-FT  | 6.3                      | 9.1   | 0.733  | 0.981  | 0.248       |\n| Slow-FT    | 45.5                     | 65.7  | 0.167  | 0.422  | 0.255       |\n\n### Potential Limitations and Caveats\n- **Temperature Sensitivity:** Maturation rates depend on temperature; variations from 30°C could affect timing.\n- **Cellular Environment:** Factors like pH, oxidation, or crowding may alter maturation kinetics slightly, though FTs are pH-stable in the relevant range (5.4–7.4).\n- **Protein Inheritance:** In multicellular yeast, daughter cells inherit proteins from mothers, which could blur age signals if not controlled with pulsed expression.\n- **Experimental Noise:** Despite high SNR, autofluorescence or photobleaching may require calibration.\n- **Long Timescales:** The 12–36h window is long relative to the cell cycle, but Fast-FT’s kinetics are supported by literature showing cellular delays ~5–10× in vitro times, which are already accounted for in cohort-based modeling."
