The protein expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose for 1\n\n(for screening of Fast-FT) or 4 h (for screening of Medium-FT and Slow-FT). Then Fast-FT and\n\nMedium-FT libraries were screened using MoFlo (Dako) fluorescence activated cell sorter\n\n(FACS). In the case of Slow-FT library, the cells were pelletted down, resuspended in RM\n\nmedium supplemented with glucose, and FACS sorted 20 h later. For FACS sorting, the bacteria\n\nwere washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM\n\nNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and then diluted with PBS to optical density of 0.02\n\nat 600 nm. MoFlo cell sorter was equipped with Krypton, Argon, and Argon-Krypton mixed-gas\n\nlasers. For detection of the blue (450/65 nm filter), green (530/40 nm filter) and red (580 nm\n\nlongpass filter) fluorescence emissions, 407, 488 and 568 nm laser lines were used, respectively.\n\nTypically about 10 sizes of each library were screened. The collected brightest blue/non\ngreen/non-red bacterial cells were rescued in rich Super Optimal broth with Catabolite repression\n\n(SOC) medium at 37[0]C for several hours, and then were spread on 0.45 µm nitrocellulose\n\nmembranes placed on Petri dishes with Luria-Bertani medium (LB)/Ampicillin and incubated for\n\novernight at 37[0]C. Next morning the membranes were placed on Rich Medium (RM)/Ampicillin\n\nPetri dishes with 0.2% arabinose to induce protein expression. After incubation for 1 h (Fast-FT)\n\nor 4 h (Medium-FT) at 37[0]C, the brightest blue/non-green/non-red colonies were marked off\n\nusing Leica MZ16F fluorescence stereomicroscope equipped with custom blue (390/40 nm\n\nexciter, 460/40 nm emitter), green (480/40 nm exciter, 530/40 nm emitter), and red (570/30 nm\n\nexciter, 615/40 nm emitter) filter sets (Chroma). In the case of Slow-FT, additional 20 h of\n\nprotein maturation time were required to select the brightest blue/non-green/dim-red colonies. 1\n\nh (Fast-FT) or 4 h (Medium-FT and Slow-FT) after the start of the expression, the membranes\n\nwere placed on Petri dishes with RM/Ampicillin/0.2% glucose to repress the protein production.\n\nThen, 24 h (Fast-FT or Medium-FT) or 48 h (Slow-FT) later, the brightest red/non-blue/non\ngreen colonies among the previously marked clones were selected.\n\n**Protein purification.** To purify recombinant proteins, LMG194 cells grown overnight were\n\ndiluted to optical density 1.0 at 600 nm, and 0.2% arabinose was added for induction of protein\n\n===== Page 12 =====\n\nexpression. The bacterial cultures were then grown at 37[0]C in 50 ml tubes filled to the brim and\ntightly sealed to restrict oxygen supply. After 1 h, the cultures were pelleted down in the same\ntightly closed tubes. After opening the tubes, the proteins were purified using B-Per reagent\n(Pierce) and Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) within 15 min with all procedures and buffers at 4[0]C.\n\n**Insect and mammalian plasmid construction.** To make pRmHa-3-FTs plasmids, the PCR\namplified EcoRI-BamHI fragments encoding FTs were inserted into pRmHa-3 vector [21]. To\ngenerate LAMP-2A-FTs fusion proteins, the PCR-amplified Xhol-Agel fragments encoding FTs\nwere swapped with TSapphire-GFP in the pcDNA-3.1-LAMP-2A-TSapphire-GFP vector (gift of\nDr. D.Reeves). To make pTRE-FTs or pTRE-LAMP-2A-FTs plasmids, the PCR amplified\n_EcoRI-Xbal fragments encoding either FTs or LAMP-2A-FTs fusion proteins, respectively, were_\ninserted into pTRE vector (Clontech).\n\n**Transfection. Transfection of Drosophila S2 cells and all mammalian cells was carried out with**\nthe Effectene reagent (Qiagen). For microscopy imaging, HeLa, Cos-1, NIH3T3 or HeLa Tet-Off\ncells were plated on 25 mm glass coverslips in Dulbecco modified essential medium (DMEM)\n(Invitrogen) supplied with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma). S2 cells were cultured in\nSchnieder’s medium (Gibco) supplied with L-glutamine and 10% FBS (Sigma) at 25[0]C. To\nestablish stable pre-clonal cell cultures, pRmHa-3-FTs plasmids were co-transfected with\npCoBlast vector (Invitrogen) and selected with 25 µg/ml of blasticidin for 2 weeks.\n\n**Staining of cellular compartments in mammalian cells.** For staining of early and recycling\nendosomes with transferrin-Alexa 488, cells were washed with PBS, and incubated in DMEM\nwithout FBS for 30 min at 37[0]C. After adding 50 µg/ml of transferrin-Alexa 488, cells were\nincubated at 4[0]C for 15 min before rinsing with PBS and further incubation in DMEM supplied\nwith 10% FBS for the next 20 min at 37[0]C. For staining of late endosomes and lysosomes, cells\nwere incubated with 100 nM of Lysotracker Green for 30 min at 37[0]C before imaging. For\nvisualization of Golgi network, HeLa Tet-Off cells were co-transfected with pTRE-LAMP-2AMedium-FT and pGalT-EYFP using 10:1 plasmid ratio.\n\n===== Page 13 =====\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Qasba, P.K., Ramakrishnan, B. & Boeggeman, E.

These variants exhibit distinctive fast, medium and slow blue-to-red chromophore maturation rates that depend on the temperature. At 37 °C, the maxima of the blue fluorescence are observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence are reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively. The FTs show similar timing behavior in bacteria, insect and mammalian cells. Medium-FT allowed for tracking of the intracellular dynamics of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) and determination of its age in the targeted compartments. The results indicate that LAMP-2A transport through the plasma membrane and early or recycling endosomes to lysosomes is a major pathway for LAMP-2A trafficking.  \n\nMonomeric fluorescent proteins of various emission wavelengths have become invaluable tools for studying the spatial behavior of intracellular molecules, including their localization and interaction\\(^1\\). To visualize temporal and spatial molecular events, FTs\\(^2\\), which change their emission wavelengths over time, could be especially valuable. The only currently available FT is DsRed-Timer FT (also known as DsRed-E5)\\(^3\\); however, it is a tetramer, which prevents its application as a protein fusion tag. Nevertheless, the tetrameric state of the DsRed-Timer does not limit its use to study gene activities\\(^4\\), relative age of organelles\\(^5\\) and cell differentiation\\(^3\\).  \n\nIt has been suggested that a red DsRed-like chromophore in the red fluorescent proteins (RfPs) results from an oxidation of a protonated blue form of the GFP-like chromophore, not from the green anionic form, which is a dead-end product\\(^6\\). This suggested scheme for red chromophore maturation provides a basis for developing monomeric FTs that change their color from blue to red. The most suitable templates for this appear to be the monomeric variants of DsRed\\(^7\\). One of these variants, mCherry, was chosen for a directed molecular evolution to develop three monomeric FTs with different maturation rates between the protonated blue GFP-like and the anionic red DsRed-like chromophore states.  \n\nFTs can be used as molecular genetically encoded tools to study trafficking of different cellular proteins and to provide accurate insight into the timing of intracellular processes. The sequence  \n\n---\n\nCorrespondence should be addressed to V.V.V.

An example of a longstanding dilemma is the contribution of different pathways to trafficking and final delivery of\nLAMP-2A to lysosomes. LAMP-2A is encoded by a spliced variant of the lamp2 gene and\nacts as a lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)[8,9]. LAMP-2A is sorted\nto endosomes and lysosomes through a tyrosine-based signal in its cytosolic C terminus, but\na fraction of the protein is also observed at the plasma membrane[10]. This dual location led\ninvestigators to propose the existence of both direct (Golgi to lysosomes) and indirect (through\nendocytosis from the plasma membrane) targeting of LAMP-2A to lysosomes[11]. The use of\nFTs has allowed us to study the sequence of events involved in transport of LAMP-2A to\nlysosomes and to determine the preferential pathway followed by LAMP-2A for its trafficking.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n**Development of monomeric FTs**\n\nThe gene encoding mCherry was used as a template for the multiple saturated mutagenesis at\npositions 42, 44, 65, 69, 106, 148, 203 and 224 (amino acid numbering follows that of Aequorea\n_victoria GFP; see Fig. 1a). These positions were identified either according to the X-ray_\nstructure of mCherry[12] or using experimental data regarding amino acid substitutions affecting\nmaturation of DsRed variants[13–15]. It has been shown that substitutions at these positions slow\nor accelerate formation of the red chromophore. According to the mCherry structure, residues\n42 and 44 are close to the Met65 residue of the mCherry chromophore, and residues 69, 148\nand 203 are close to the phenolic and/or imidazolinone rings of the chromophore. Residue 224\nwas found in close proximity to residue 203 and has been suggested to indirectly influence\nchromophore positioning. Therefore, a bacterial library of mutants at positions 42, 44, 65, 69,\n106, 148, 203 and 224 was screened for clones with fast, medium and slow maturation rates\nusing a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) followed by analysis of the collected colonies\non petri dishes using a fluorescence stereomicroscope.\n\nAs a result of screening the library of mutants with the site-specific substitutions at the eight\npositions indicated above, mCherry K69R and mCherry K69R A224S mutants with FT\nphenotypes were found (Supplementary Table 1 online). These mutants exhibited blue forms\nthat were not detected in the original mCherry. However, the brightness of the blue fluorescence\nwas very low in the case of mCherry K69R. The maturation rates of the red forms were slowed\nas compared to that of mCherry. Other mutations found in the analyzed variants did not lead\nto the FT phenotypes. Because the mCherry K69R A224S mutant exhibited the blue form\nearlier than the mCherry K69R variant, the former was further used for random mutagenesis\nto screen for the fast-FT phenotype. Consequently, the mCherry K69R mutant was used as a\ntemplate for random mutagenesis aimed to screen for medium-FT and slow-FT phenotypes.\nSequential rounds of the random mutagenesis followed by screening of mutant clones using\nFACS and fluorescence stereomicroscopy were applied. The bacterial libraries of random\nmutants typically consisted of 10[6] to 10[7] clones.\n\nThe number of rounds for random mutagenesis varied depending on the specific FT phenotype\nand consisted of four, five and three rounds for the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT,\nrespectively. Over several rounds of random mutagenesis, the fluorescence intensities of both\nblue and red forms of the best FT variants increased and reached plateaus (Supplementary Fig.\n1 online). When we were not able to find a better variant in the next round of mutagenesis, we\nstopped improvement of that FT using random mutagenesis.\n\nA key mutation found in the first round of mutagenesis for all FT phenotypes was L84W.\nVariants containing this amino acid substitution exhibited substantially brighter blue and red\nfluorescence intensities. Mutations at position 18 such as M18V and M18L resulted in a slight\n\n_Nat Chem Biol.

Therefore we decided to choose variants with these mutations for the next random mutagenesis.\n\nDuring the subsequent rounds of mutagenesis, several additional internal positions such as 112, 143, 152, 179 and 205, which contained important substitutions, were found. For example, in the fast-FT phenotype, the mutation S112T increased the brightness of both red and blue forms to about the same extent. In the medium-FT phenotype, mutations M143K and L205M increased the brightness of the blue form and increased the efficiency of the blue-to-red chromophore maturation. The introduction of M152L and M152I amino acid substitutions in medium-FT variants substantially increased the brightness of the red but not the blue form. Several mutations such as F63C, S112C and A179V reduced chromophore maturation rates; however, only the latter mutation did not decrease the brightness of the blue form, and therefore we chose this mutation for the slow-FT phenotype.\n\nTo make sure that during the multistage screening and selection procedures we did not miss mutants with some advantageous substitutions at the identified key positions, we applied the best fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT variants found in the random mutagenesis for an additional saturated site-specific mutagenesis at positions 69, 84, 143, 179, 203 and 205. However, no better FT versions were found. The final residues neighboring the chromophore in each construct are shown in Figure 1b-d, and all important mutations found during the molecular evolution of mCherry into the FTs are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nProperties of FTs in vitro\n\nThe fluorescence properties of the new constructs were investigated (Fig. 2). The blue forms of the purified fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT had excitation/emission peaks of 403/466, 401/464 and 402/465 nm, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2a for fast-FT; other FTs exhibited similar spectra). The respective red forms had excitation/emission peaks of 583/606, 579/600 and 583/604 nm. The absorbance of both forms had the same maxima as the fluorescence excitation spectra. The external mutations in the FTs were located outside of the dimerizing interfaces observed in the DsRed structure\\(^16\\). Subsequently, like the parental mCherry, all FTs exhibited the monomeric behavior (Supplementary Fig. 2 online).\n\nMolar extinction coefficients and quantum yields of the blue forms of the FTs were in the range of 33,400-49,700 M\\(^{-1}\\)cm\\(^{-1}\\) and 0.30-0.41, respectively (Table 1). The fluorescence of the blue forms exhibited high pH stability, with pKa values below 3.0 (Fig. 2g). For comparison, the best blue fluorescent protein reported so far, EBFP2, has lower pH stability, with a pKa value of about 4.5. Extinction coefficients of the FT red forms were higher than those of the blue forms and varied between 73,100 and 84,200 M\\(^{-1}\\)cm\\(^{-1}\\). The quantum yields for the FT red forms varied in the range of 0.05-0.09. The fluorescences of the red forms had pH stabilities similar to those of the parental mCherry, with pKa values of 4.1-4.7 (Fig. 2h). Because the fluorescence of both blue and red forms decreased with acidification, the ratio between these fluorescence intensities changed with pH notably less than the red signal but more than the blue signal (Fig. 2i). For all FTs, the ratio changed less than 8% within the pH range of 5.4-7.4.\n\nDuring the FT maturation, the fluorescence of the blue forms increased to its maximum value, and after that decreased to zero (Fig. 2a-c). The fluorescence of the red forms increased with time with some delay and then reached a plateau. At 37 °C the maxima of the blue fluorescence intensities were observed at 0.25, 1.2 and 9.8 h for the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT, respectively. The half-maxima of the red fluorescence intensities were reached at 7.1, 3.9 and 28 h, respectively, which corresponds to the half-times of the maturation for the red FT forms. These characteristic times increased at lower temperatures such as 16 °C and 25 °C and decreased at higher temperatures such as 45 °C (Table 1). The ratios between the red and blue\n\n===== Page 4 =====\n\nfluorescence intensities exhibited parabolic growth dependencies with time for each FT. The higher the temperature, the faster the growth of the red-to-blue ratio; this observation provided a single meaning for the age of the particular FT (Fig. 2d-f). These ratio curves can be easily adapted for other instruments using the ratio of the reference dyes. Furthermore, these data suggest that calibration curves based on the FT red-to-blue ratio can be used to determine the time from the start of FT production under any specific conditions.\n\nTo quantitatively describe the chromophore conversion pathway in the FTs, we applied kinetic model (1). This model was based on the proposed earlier mechanism for chromophore formation in tetrameric DsRed protein [6]. A spectrally undetectable C-form, which represents a cyclized chromophore-forming tripeptide in the reduced (and therefore colorless) state, is converted into a blue form (B-form), which then turns into a red form (R-form) (Scheme 1). It has been shown that in fluorescent proteins, polypeptide folding and cyclization of the chromophore-forming tripeptide occur substantially faster than the oxidation steps [17]. The formation of the B-form precedes the red chromophore formation in many red FPs including DsRed and HeRed1. It has been suggested that the B-form is a common intermediate for the red chromophores [6]. For the FTs, model (1) consisted of the following kinetic steps:\n\n\\[\\text{C}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{B}}}\\text{B}\\xrightarrow{k_{1}}\\text{I}\\xrightarrow {k_{\\text{R}}}\\text{R}\\] (1)\n\nwhere C and I are the nonfluorescent chromophore forms, B and R are the blue and red forms of FTs, and \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\), \\(k_{\\text{I}}\\) and \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) are the kinetic rate constants [6] (Scheme 1). It has been suggested that the B-form is a protonated (neutral) form of the GFP-like chromophore p-(hydroxybenzylidene)-imidazolin-5-one [18]. This form results from an oxidation of the Tyr66 αC-βC bond of the C-form with the formation of a double bond. The mature deprotonated (anionic) R-form contains an additional double bond between the α carbon and amide nitrogen of Met65. The I-forms may present an unstable short-lived carbanion intermediate, which is formed from the B-form by a proton abstraction from the α carbon of Met65. The formation of the carbanion intermediate is possible because of stabilization, by a side chain of Arg69 (which is introduced to all FTs by site-specific mutagenesis), of the negative charge delocalized within the aromatic system.\n\nTwo steps in the mechanism of red chromophore formation (C\\(\\rightarrow\\)B and I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R) are irreversible because both of them are accompanied by chromophore oxidation with the formation of the double bonds [6, 12, 16]. The step B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I is the deprotonation of the neutral blue form with formation of at least one intermediate compound, such as the carbanion. Because the exact number and chemical nature of the intermediate compounds is unknown and particularly because the next I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R oxidation step is irreversible, we have approximated the B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I process by irreversible reaction.\n\nWe used model (1) above to fit the experimental FT maturation curves obtained _in vitro_ for all three purified proteins at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C (presented in Fig. 2c for the fast-FT at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C). We further determined rate constants for each chromophore maturation step in the FTs at different temperatures (Scheme 1 and Supplementary Table 2 online). The \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\) constants were substantially larger than \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) for the fast-FT and slow-FT, which indicates that the I\\(\\rightarrow\\)R steps were the limiting reactions for red chromophore formation in these FTs. In the case of medium-FT, the limiting step for red form formation was B\\(\\rightarrow\\)I. This suggests that the long-lived intermediate I-form or blue B-form might be responsible for the delays in the formation of the FT red forms--that is, for the timing behavior.\n\n===== Page 5 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 5\n\nBehavior of FTs in different cell types\n\nTo study the behavior of the FTs in a system other than bacteria, we expressed them in stable clones of Drosophila melanogaster Schrieder’s 2 (S2) cells under the control of the inducible metallothionein promoter\\(^{19}\\). After the induction with copper sulfate of the fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT for 0.5, 1 and 2 h, respectively, expression was stopped. The blue and red fluorescence of the S2 cells was then analyzed using flow cytometry at different times during 15 days of cell growth at 25 °C (Fig. 3).\n\nTo study timing in mammalian cells, the FTs were expressed in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells at 37 °C using the Tet-Off system\\(^{20}\\). Several hours after the transfection, transcription was stopped by addition of a doxycycline, and later the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at different times (see Fig. 4a for slow-FT; other FTs resulted in similar histograms).\n\nAs with the purified FTs and the proteins expressed in bacteria, the blue fluorescence of the insect cells at 25 °C and mammalian cells at 37 °C expressing the FTs increased, reached its maxima, and then decreased to almost zero. The red fluorescence also increased with time; however, in contrast to the in vitro data, it then slowly decreased (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4b). Furthermore, for all FTs the growth of the blue and red forms and the decrease of the blue forms were slower than those for the purified FTs. These data indicate that (i) the translation of FTs occurs for some time after termination of transcription with doxycycline or removal of copper sulfate and (ii) like other proteins, the FTs are susceptible to proteasomal degradation.\n\nTo quantitatively describe the kinetics of the blue and red FT forms in live S2 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 3 online), we modified the above model (1) with two minimal additional kinetic steps and got the following kinetic model (2):\n\n\\[N \\xrightarrow{k_C} C \\xrightarrow{k_B} B \\xrightarrow{k_1} I \\xrightarrow{k_R} R \\xrightarrow{k_D} D\\]\n\nwhere N is ribonucleic acid, D is the degraded nonfluorescent FTs and \\( k_C \\) and \\( k_D \\) are the kinetic rate constants. The first step (from ribonucleic acid to cyclized chromophore-forming tripeptide form) reflects prolongation of protein translation from the ribonucleic acid N after termination of its transcription. The second step (from the red FT to the degraded nonfluorescent FT) reflects degradation of FTs in live cells to the nondetectable D form.\n\nThe resulting values of \\( k_C \\) for S2 cells were rather close for all FTs (0.009-0.013 h\\(^{-1}\\): Supplementary Table 2). This was also true for the \\( k_C \\) rate constants in HeLa cells (0.29 h\\(^{-1}\\) for medium-FT and 0.30 h\\(^{-1}\\) for slow-FT), which indicates similar lifetimes for the FT mRNAs in the same type of cells. The \\( k_C \\) values for the HeLa cells suggest that the mRNA amount should be 10% after 8 h and 3% after 12 h incubation with doxycycline. A similar time course for the activity of the luciferase has been observed after inhibition of its transcription with tetracycline\\(^{20}\\). Within 8 h, luciferase activity dropped to about 10% and was less than 2% of its original value after 12 h\\(^{20}\\). The \\( k_D \\) values observed for the FTs at 37 °C were in good agreement with previous reports on the 24 h half-life time for GFP in mammalian cell cytoplasm after the inhibition of its transcription and translation\\(^{21}\\).\n\nIntracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A\n\nTo explore the advantage of the FTs in vivo, we used FTs to study the intracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A. Previous studies on LAMPs trafficking using biochemical and immunofluorescence approaches had suggestedthat LAMPs canreach thelysosomevia twointracellular routes: a direct pathway from the Golgi to the late endosomes and lysosomes\\(^{22,23}\\), and an indirect pathway from the Golgi to the plasma membrane following\n\n*Nat Chem Biol.* Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1.\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nthe secretory pathway, and then to lysosomes via endocytosis[24-26]. Although it was initially\nconsidered that the pool of LAMPs at the plasma membrane was only evident under certain\nconditions (such as platelet activation or certain tumors), later studies knocking down adaptor\ntrafficking proteins demonstrated that a portion of cellular LAMPs can be detected at the plasma\nmembrane even under normal physiological conditions (reviewed in ref. [10]). In fact, analysis\nof chimera proteins of the luminal region of LAMP-1 and the three different cytosolic tails of\nLAMP-2 revealed that the variants reaching the plasma membrane were mainly LAMP-2A\nand LAMP-2B (ref. 27). However, in most of the previous studies, the plasma membrane\nlocation of the LAMPs was analyzed at a steady state. Although the combined use of surface\nbiotinylation and cellular permeabilization helped to demonstrate that some membrane LAMPs\nare internalized, it was not possible to determine which fraction of the total LAMPs transits\nthrough the plasma membrane in a dynamic manner. Lastly, in all the previous studies relying\non biochemical analysis, individual differences from cell to cell on the dynamics of\ninternalization of LAMPs from the plasma membrane could not be determined. We predicted\nthat using LAMP-2A-FT fusion proteins, we could possibly estimate the age of the LAMP-2A\nmolecules in different cellular compartments during their trafficking and determine the main\nLAMP-2A targeting mechanism.\n\nTo choose an FT with the appropriate timing behavior, we first tested the localization of\nLAMP-2A fusion constructs with all FTs expressed under the constitutive cytomegalovirus\npromoter. Several types of mammalian cells exhibiting different levels of CMA activity were\ntransiently transfected with this construct (see Supplementary Fig. 4 online for Cos-1 cells).\nWe observed that in the case of LAMP-2A-fast-FT, the blue form mainly localized in an area\ncompatible with the Golgi, and the red form was visualized as vesicular structures (endosomes\nor lysosomes). The blue form of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT localized in the Golgi, plasma\nmembrane and vesicular structures, and the red form was predominantly detected in the\nvesicular formations. In the case of the LAMP-2A-slow-FT, the blue form was observed in the\nvesicular structures, with only a small amount at the cell membrane. All of the red form of the\nLAMP-2A-slow-FT was observed in the vesicles. Because the LAMP-2A-medium-FT fusion\ncan be detected in several cellular compartments at the same time, this construct was further\napplied to study trafficking using the Tet-Off system.\n\nWe found that at 1 and 6 h after the pulse-chase expression, an early blue form of the LAMP-2Amedium-FT was the major fluorescent form observed in live HeLa Tet-Off cells (Fig. 4c). The\namount of the blue form then gradually decreased until its complete disappearance at 63 h,\nwhereas the late red form of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT increased, reaching its maximum\nbetween 36.5 and 63 h (Fig. 4c). The newly synthesized fusion protein was slowly trafficked\nthrough the Golgi, where it could be detected for up to 12 h. Between 6 and 21 h, a percentage\nof the blue form was also observed at the plasma membrane, which, however, was never\nhighlighted with the late red protein. These data indicate that LAMP-2A at the plasma\nmembrane did not result from the fusion of pre-existing lysosomal compartments, but was\nprimarily targeted there from the Golgi after synthesis.\n\nTo identify the nature of the vesicular compartments in which LAMP-2A-medium-FT was\ndetected, we applied transferrin-Alexa 488 to visualize early and recycling endosomes, and\nLysotracker Green to stain late endosomes and lysosomes (Supplementary Fig. 5 online). At\n6 h after the expression, we observed almost complete co-localization of the late red form of\nthe fusion protein with transferrin-Alexa 488. At 12 and 21 h the co-localization became partial,\nand only a very small fraction of the LAMP-2A-medium-FT merged with transferrin-Alexa\n488 at later times. In contrast, co-localization of the red form with Lysotracker Green was\npartial at 6 and 12 h, but became almost complete at all times after 21 h.\n\n_Nat Chem Biol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 February 1._\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 7\n\nBecause the intense blue fluorescence at the perinuclear region could be masking individual lysosomal structures and thus might complicate discrimination between the different compartments in that region, we also imaged the blue form of LAMP-2A-medium-FT in combination with Lysotracker Green to discriminate between compartments based on a red-to-blue ratio. The regions where blue or red fluorescence was merged with Lysotracker Green were referred to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Bright blue fluorescence was not observed in the regions merged with Lysotracker Green at early times after LAMP-2A-medium-FT expression (Supplementary Fig. 6 online). The red signal of LAMP-2A-medium-FT in the regions co-stained with Lysotracker Green was substantially larger than that in the perinuclear region. Even when lysosomes identified with Lysotracker staining were occasionally found in the perinuclear region, their red fluorescence was substantially brighter than the red fluorescence in other parts of the perinuclear region that were not stained with Lysotracker.\n\nTo determine the nature of the intense blue signal in the perinuclear region observed at earlier times of pulse-chase expression of LAMP-2A-medium-FT, we used β-1,4-galactosyltransferase-EYFP (GalT-EYFP) as a Golgi marker[28, 29, 30]. GalT is anchored in the membranes of the trans-Golgi network[30, 31, 32]. The Golgi marker merged with the intense blue signal localized in the perinuclear region at 1 and 6 h after expression (Supplementary Fig. 7 online). At later times, the blue signal only coincided partially with GalT-EYFP, whereas co-localization of the red signal with the Golgi marker was not observed at any time after the LAMP-2A expression. These results support the observation that the bright blue fluorescence observed at the perinuclear region corresponds to molecules of LAMP-2A still in the Golgi.\n\nWe took advantage of the FT monomeric states to estimate the mean age for the LAMP-2A-medium-FT molecules in different organelles. It is unlikely that a fusion partner such as LAMP-2A affects maturation of the FT chromophore, which is tightly shielded inside of the β-can. Therefore, the same maturation times of blue and red forms of the free FT and FT fusion construct should correspond to the same time after FT expression in both cases. To preserve functionality of the chimera we fused the FTs to the N terminus of LAMP-2A, which is located in the lysosomal lumen. We determined that the red-to-blue ratio for medium-FT had small changes in the pH range of 5.4-7.4 (Fig. 2i). This is an important issue because pH values close to 5.4 have been detected in late endosomes and lysosomes, whereas pH values not exceeding 7.4 have been observed in Golgi, early and recycling endosomes, and cytoplasm. These observations allowed us to apply the kinetic model that successfully described spectral changes of the cytoplasmically expressed FTs in live cells. In other words, by comparing the red-to-blue ratios for free medium-FT detected with flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 3) to those for LAMP-2A-medium-FT obtained using cell imaging (Fig. 4c), we have estimated the mean ages of the fusion construct in each of the targeted compartments at various times after its expression has stopped (Table 2). The evaluated mean ages in different compartments indicate the indirect intracellular trafficking of LAMP-2A from the Golgi through the plasma membrane and early or recycling endosomes to the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. 12 h after expression, most of the protein resides in the late endosomes and lysosomes.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThe primary aim of this investigation was development of new tools to study the spatial and temporal distribution of individual proteins in live cells. As a result of the mutagenesis screening, we have found three monomeric FTs with distinctive blue-to-red conversion timing, which we named fast-FT, medium-FT and slow-FT. The fast-FT has five amino acid mutations as compared to the original mCherry. Among them K69R, L84W and A224S are internal to the β-can mCherry fold and E34K and S151T are external to the fold. The medium-FT exhibits nine amino acid substitutions, of which K69R, L84W, M152I and L205M are internal, and N23D, T43S, Q194L, Y221C and R227H are external. The slow-FT has only four mutations,\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\nof which K69R, L84W and A179V are internal and E30V is external. The immediate environment of the chromophores of the FTs is shown in Figure 1b-d.\n\nAll FTs contain K69R and L84W substitutions. According to the mCherry structure[12], a residue at position 84 influences positioning of residue 69. For example, K84L substitution in mCherry relative to the original DsRed resulted in a 2.7-Å shift of Lys69. Similarly, L84W mutation can lead to a change of position of Arg69 in FTs. On the other hand, the amino acid at position 69 alone plays an important role in formation of the red chromophore. Lysine or arginine amino acids are almost always found at this position in RFPs[14]. In DsRed, K69R is the only substitution that preserved formation of the red chromophore, while slowing its maturation, whereas other substitutions at this position resulted in green chromophores[33]. Therefore Arg69 and Trp84 appear to be the key amino acids responsible for the timing behavior of the mCherry-based blue-to-red FTs.\n\nOther substitutions observed in the FTs are possibly involved in time-tuning of each particular FT. In the mCherry structure, Ala224 forms van der Waals contact with Ile203, which is in close proximity to the chromophore[12]. The A224S substitution in the fast-FT introduces an additional hydroxyl group affecting positioning of Ile203.\n\nLeu205 in mCherry forms several van der Waals contacts with the tyrosine in the chromophore. In addition, Met152 forms van der Waals contacts with Glu150 and Tyr185, which are in close proximity to the chromophore. Therefore, M152I and L205M mutations in the medium-FT can influence red chromophore maturation.\n\nThe Ala179 residue in the mCherry structure forms van der Waals contacts with the internal amino acids Met98 and Phe100. However, in the DsRed structure[16], Met98 and Phe100 have van der Waals contacts with Val105. As compared to DsRed, DsRed-E5 FT has only two substitutions, V105A and S203T (ref. 3). Therefore we speculate that the A179V mutation observed in the slow-FT may affect the maturation rate of the red chromophore, much like V105A substitution in DsRed-E5.\n\nIn this work we demonstrate the advantages of FTs for visualizing temporal and spatial molecular events using as example the intracellular trafficking of a lysosomal membrane protein. Based on the red-to-blue ratios observed for LAMP-2A-medium-FT in different compartments at various imaging time points, one may suggest the following major intracellular traffic pattern for the protein: Golgi → plasma membrane → early and recycling endosomes → late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data support the predominant indirect targeting of LAMP-2A to lysosomes[11]. The relatively low LAMP-2A levels observed at the plasma membrane suggest a rather short retention time for the protein in this compartment. In fact, at various imaging time points the mean ages of the LAMP-2A-medium-FTs in early and recycling endosomes differ substantially from those in the Golgi (Table 2). On the other hand, the difference between the ages of LAMP-2A proteins in the Golgi and those at the plasma membrane is small, which suggests that LAMP-2A is present there for a rather limited time. Therefore, any additional protein flow from the Golgi directly to early and recycling endosomes and then to lysosomes seems to be unlikely.\n\nThe use of FTs to study this process has also allowed us to identify a small fraction of LAMP-2A that recycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane. This conclusion is based on the following: if LAMP-2A travels from the Golgi to early endosomes and then recycles between endosomes and the plasma membrane, we should see two populations of endosomes with the different ages of LAMP-2A-FT. The first population would have a red-to-blue ratio smaller than or equal to that on the plasma membrane, while the second population could have a red-to-blue ratio larger than that on the membrane. The microscopy data clearly indicate that for the majority of early and recycling endosomes, the red-to-blue ratio is larger than that on the\n\n===== Page 9 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 9\n\nplasma membrane. However, there is a small fraction (less than 20%) of early and recycling endosomes that have red-to-blue ratios comparable to those on the membrane, but never smaller. Consequently, a quite small fraction of LAMP-2A is involved in the recycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes.\n\nOur results provide, to our knowledge for the first time, an in vivo analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a lysosomal membrane protein. Specifically, the FTs allowed us (i) to follow the trafficking of LAMP-2A, (ii) to confirm the universality of the indirect pathway without having to introduce genetic modifications in the adaptor proteins (thus allowing us to avoid possible compensatory mechanisms), (iii) to establish that engagement of LAMP-2A through the indirect pathway is not a default mechanism, but instead, as proposed through the genetic analysis, affects a large percentage of the intracellular protein and (iv) to estimate the time of trafficking to the plasma membrane and from the membrane to lysosomes in live intact cells, without subjecting the cell membrane to modifications with biotinylation or permeabilization.\n\nThe analysis of LAMP-2A behavior demonstrates the advantages of using monomeric FTs to elucidate the dynamics of intracellular proteins under various physiological and pathological conditions. The monomeric FT proteins will also allow for identification of recycling events among compartments, temporal tracking of molecules before and after a particular cellular event (without the need for additional labeling or artificial photoswitching) and timing of particular intracellular post-translational modifications traceable by fluorescent procedures such as ubiquitination and farnesylation. Selection of the appropriate FT is an important step to reveal timing of the specific cellular process to be studied. Therefore, availability of three FTs with distinctive chromophore maturation times will be useful for studies of cellular processes with substantially different time scales. Furthermore, the blue and red fluorescent colors provide the possibility to use FTs together with GFPs for protein multicolor labeling in the cell. The FT monomeric states will be useful for FRET applications with GFP-labeled FRET partners. In contrast to tetrameric DsRed-E5, the monomeric FTs will allow a sequential bimolecular fluorescence complementation of FT molecules followed by FT maturation to determine the intracellular timing of protein-protein interactions\\(^2\\).\n\nMETHODS\nMutagenesis\n\nThe gene encoding mCherry was PCR amplified as a BgIII-EcoRI fragment and inserted into a pBAD/His-B vector (Invitrogen). Site-specific mutagenesis of the gene encoding mCherry was performed using QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For simultaneous mutagenesis at several positions, an overlap-extension approach was applied\\(^3\\)4. Random mutagenesis was performed with GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using conditions resulting in a mutation frequency of up to 16 mutations per 1,000 base pairs. After mutagenesis, a mixture of the mutants was electroporated into LMG194 bacteria (Invitrogen).\n\nLibrary screening\n\nTo find FTs with distinctive timing behavior, libraries of mutants cloned under the arabinose promoter were screened for bright blue and non-red clones at different times after the induction of protein expression—usually 1, 4 or 24 h for the relatively fast, medium and slow chromophore formation rates, respectively. Then, protein production was suppressed with glucose, and the selected clones were re-screened for the bright red and non-blue phenotype 24 and 48 h later for the fast-medium and the slow maturation rates, respectively. After each round of screening, about 8-10 mutants were considered as promising for the next rounds of mutagenesis; these mutants were characterized by (i) distinctive blue-to-red fluorescence\n\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nNIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nNai Chem Biol.

Further details are described in the Supplementary Methods online.\n\n### Protein characterization\n\nMaturation of the blue and red forms was studied at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To determine extinction coefficients, we relied on measuring the mature chromophore concentrations [35], taking into account that the extinction coefficient of the model compound of the tyrosine-containing GFP-like chromophores is 44,000 M\\({}^{-1}\\) cm\\({}^{-1}\\) at 447 nm in 1 M NaOH [35] and about 28,500 M\\({}^{-1}\\) cm\\({}^{-1}\\) at 382 nm in 1 M HCl [36]. In the case of blue forms, freshly purified proteins were acid-denatured. In the case of red forms, the proteins matured at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 24-48 h and afterwards were alkali-denatured. To determine quantum yields, the fluorescence intensities of the blue and red forms were compared with equally absorbing EGFP (quantum yield is 0.60; ref. [37]) and mCherry (quantum yield is 0.22; ref. [38]), respectively. pH titrations were performed using a series of buffers (100 mM NaOAc, 300 mM NaCl for pH 2.5-5.0, and 100 mM NaH\\({}_{2}\\)PO\\({}_{4}\\), 300 mM NaCl for pH 4.5-9.0). All fluorescence measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon). The ratio between the emissions of 0.1 \\(\\upmu\\)M rhodamine-101 in 0.01% (w/v) HCl in ethanol at 604 nm (excited at 580 nm) and 10 \\(\\upmu\\)M quinine sulfate in 0.1 M H\\({}_{2}\\)SO\\({}_{4}\\) at 465 nm (excited at 402 nm) under the identical instrumental conditions at 25 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C was 33.7.\n\n### Kinetic model for FT maturation\n\nTo quantitatively describe the chromophore conversion pathway in the FTs, we considered two kinetic models, (1) and (3). These models were based on the proposed earlier mechanism for the chromophore formation in tetrameric DsRed protein [6]. Model (3) consisted of the following kinetic steps:\n\n\\[\\text{C}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{B}}}\\text{B}\\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{R}}} \\text{R}\\] (3)\n\nModel (1) extends (3) by introducing an intermediate I-form between the B-form and R-form (see above) [6]. We used models (1) and (3) to fit the experimental FT maturation curves obtained _in vitro_ for all three purified proteins at 16, 25, 37 and 45 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C using the Gepasi chemical kinetics simulation software [39] with the maximal amount of the red forms accepted as 100%. Model (3) described poorly the experimental data on the kinetics of the maturation of the B-form and R-form in all three FTs. The simulated curves for model (3) had coefficients of determination, \\(R^{2}\\), in the range of 0.40-0.62 for the different FTs. The introduction of only a single I-intermediate in model (3) substantially improved the quantitative description of the experimentally observed maturation kinetics for the B-form and R-form. For all three FTs, the simulated curves for model (1) provided \\(R^{2}\\) values above 0.99. Therefore we further applied model (1) to describe the kinetic behavior of both the blue and red forms.\n\nTo quantitatively describe kinetics of the blue and red FT forms in live S2 and HeLa cells, we used kinetic model (2) (see above). The mean brightnesses for the blue and red forms measured by flow cytometry for the FTs cytoplasmically expressed in S2 and HeLa Tet-Off cells were fitted with kinetic model (2) using the Gepasi software [39]. For fitting, the kinetic constants \\(k_{\\text{B}}\\), \\(k_{\\text{I}}\\) and \\(k_{\\text{R}}\\) were kept the same as for the purified proteins.\n\n### FACS sorting of _D. melanogaster_ S2 and HeLa Tet-Off cells\n\nFT expression in the stable S2 pre-clonal cell mixture was induced with 1 mM of CuSO\\({}_{4}\\) for 0.5 h for fast-FT, for 1 h for medium-FT and for 2 h for slow-FT. At specific times after either\n\n===== Page 11 =====\n\nSubach et al. Page 11\n\nwashing out of CuSO\\(_4\\) (S2) or addition of doxycycline (HeLa), the cells were analyzed with a MoFlo cell sorter using excitation laser lines and emission filters similar to those used for the screening of bacterial libraries.\n\nMicroscopy imaging\nImaging of HeLa, Cos-1, NIH3T3 and HeLa Tet-Off cells was performed 13-122 h after transfection. In the case of HeLa Tet-Off cells, doxycycline was added 12 h after the transfection to stop protein expression. Cells were imaged using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a \\(\\times 100\\) oil immersion objective lens, with custom blue (390/40 nm exciter, 460/40 nm emitter) and red (570/30 nm exciter, 615/40 nm emitter) filter sets (Chroma), that was operated with SlideBook 4.1 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Because FTs have a tendency to photoconvert from the blue to the red form with high-intensity violet light, which may cause light-induced chromophore maturation, cell images were first acquired in the red channel and then in the blue channel. For quantification of red and blue fluorescence intensities in cellular regions of interest, the background autofluorescence measured in the respective regions of nonfluorescent cells on the same coverslip was usually subtracted.\n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank J.

However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes\\(^{5-7}\\), understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MULTEE)\\(^8\\), we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being economically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation.\n\nPolyploidy, resulting from WGD, is widespread in nature and is an important driver of species adaptation and diversification\\(^{1,3}\\). Most, if not all, living species bear signatures of ancient WGDs\\(^{3,9}\\). However, the establishment of nascent polyploids is rarely successful\\(^{10,11}\\), as newly formed polyploids usually face fitness disadvantages when competing in a population of diploids under normal environments\\(^{12}\\). Furthermore, nascent polyploids often exhibit genomic instability\\(^{3-7}\\) and rapidly revert to diploidy via chromosome losses\\(^{13-15}\\) (although certain genetic changes can stabilize polyploidy\\(^{16}\\)). This costly and transient nature of nascent polyploidy raises the question of how polyploidy can rise and be maintained over long-term evolution. A central hypothesis is that the immediate phenotypic effects of polyploidy, often stemming from the increased size of polyploid cells, can confer fitness advantages under novel, often stressful, environments\\(^{21,17-20}\\). This has been suggested to contribute to many ancient WGDs that rose during periods of drastic climate change\\(^{21}\\). However, it remains elusive whether selection on the immediate phenotypic effects of nascent polyploidy is sufficient to drive its rise and long-term persistence, especially given the genomic instability of polyploidy that typically erodes recently duplicated genomes.\n\nThe instability of nascent polyploid genomes may provide an evolutionary advantage under novel environments by rapidly generating genetic variation, especially via aneuploidy\\(^{22}\\). This has been shown to facilitate the rapid evolution of microorganisms\\(^{2,23-25}\\) and cancer\\(^{1,26,27}\\). Although this benefit of WGD often arises as the transient polyploids undergo genome reduction towards diploidy, it remains untested whether WGD can also facilitate adaptation via novel aneuploidy when polyploidy is maintained (that is, it still possesses a baseline tetraploid genome content), potentially fuelling longer-term adaptation.\n\nUnderstanding how WGDs rise, persist and drive both short-term and long-term adaptation is fundamental to our understanding of their evolutionary impacts. Our current knowledge about WGDs is largely based on the comparison of natural polyploids with their diploid relatives, which, although informative, can be confounded by evolution following WGD establishment and concomitant evolutionary processes other than WGD. Experimental evolution provides a novel opportunity to overcome these limitations\\(^{14,15}\\). However, to our knowledge, no previous work has observed how polyploidy arises de novo from diploids, and the rapid losses of polyploidy in laboratory experiments limits our ability to study the long-term maintenance and consequences of\n\n\\(^{1}\\)School of Biological Sciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA. \\(^{2}\\)Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Quantitative Biosciences, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA. \\(^{3}\\)Biological Design Center, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA. \\(^{4}\\)Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA. \\(^{5}\\)School of Integrative Biology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA. \\(^{6}\\)Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine, Rochester, MI, USA. \\(^{7}\\)School of Physics, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA. \\(^{8}\\)Department of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. \\(^{9}\\)Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA. \\(^{10}\\)These authors contributed equally; Kai Tong, Sayantan Datta. \\(^{11}\\)e-mail: kaitong@bu.edu; ratcliff@gatech.edu\n\nNature | www.nature.com | 1\n\n===== Page 2 =====\n\n# Article\n\nWGD. Thus, we lack an experimental system for directly examining how WGDs spontaneously arise and subsequently evolve over long evolutionary timescales.\n\nOur ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTE) provides a unique experimental system to circumvent these long-standing constraints. Initially designed to study the open-ended evolution of a nascent multicellular organism, we subjected mixotrophic and anaerobic populations of snowflake yeast (\\(S. cerevisiae\\)), a model of undifferentiated multicellularity, to 1,000 rounds (approximately 5,000 generations) of daily selection for larger size. We found that in all replicate populations, tetraploidy rapidly evolved from diploid ancestors and has been maintained over the rest of the experiment. We found that tetraploidy initially evolved because it produces larger clusters made of larger, longer cells, an immediate advantage under our size-based selection. Continuous selection for larger size also maintained tetraploidy for unprecedented timescales, despite its intrinsic tendency to regress back towards diploidy. Moreover, although polyploidy evolved in both mixotrophic and anaerobic populations, the former remained microscopic and predominantly euphold, whereas the latter evolved extensive aneuploidy, which underpins the subsequent origins of macroscopic multicellular size. Together, we provide direct experimental evidence that selection on the immediate phenotypic effects of polyploidy is sufficient to drive its rise and long-term persistence, and when polyploidy is maintained, its intrinsic genomic instability can fuel long-term adaptation through aneuploidy.\n\n## 1,000 days of multicellular evolution\n\nWe began the MuLTE (Fig. 1a) with the goal of examining the open-ended evolution of a nascent multicellular organism\\(^8\\). The snowflake yeast ancestor that we used to initiate the MuLTE is a homozygous diploid \\(S. cerevisiae ACE2\\) knockout, which causes incomplete cell separation after mitosis\\(^9\\). Snowflake yeast grow as clonal multicellular groups and reproduce through branch fragmentation induced by cell packing stress\\(^10\\), we evolved snowflake yeast with three metabolic treatments: mixotrophic, obligately anaerobic and obligately aerobic, each with five replicate populations (that is, lines). In this study, we focus on the five mixotrophic populations (PMI–5), which were started with a mixotrophic ancestor, and the five anaerobic populations (PAI–5), which descend from a petite mutant within non-functional mitochondria. We subjected these populations to daily cycles of growth and selection for rapid settling through liquid media, favouring both rapid growth and larger multicellular size. Although PAs evolved to be approximately 20,000-fold larger within 600 days (approximately 3,000 generations), forming macroscopic clusters, PMs only increased in size by approximately sixfold\\(^9\\). This was because limited oxygen diffusion constrains the evolution of increased size under mixotrophic, but not anaerobic, metabolism\\(^10\\).\n\nWe have continued the MuLTE for 400 more transfers, or 1,000 days (approximately 5,000 generations) in total (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). In our model system, novel multicellular traits (for example, larger, tougher clusters) arise as an emergent property of changes in cell-level traits (for example, increased cell aspect ratio\\(^11\\)-\\(^12\\)). Here we characterized the evolutionary history of Key group-level and cell-level traits across the first 1,000 days of the MuLTE (Fig. 1c – e and Extended Data Fig. 2). We focus particularly on the evolution of cell volume, as this has not been systematically examined in our system and is a common phenotypic effect of WGD\\(^9\\). We found that the PMs experienced a 1.9-fold increase in cell volume within the first 200 days of our experiment (\\(P = 7.53 \\times 10^{-5}\\), \\(t_s = 16.7\\), two-tailed one-sample Student’s t test), which remained largely unchanged for the rest of the experiment (\\(P = 0.637\\), \\(F_{316} = 0.58\\), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); Fig. 1d). Similarly, the cell volume in PAs increased by 2.3-fold during the first 200 days (\\(P = 1.07 \\times 10^{-5}\\), \\(t_s = 27.3\\), two-tailed one-sample Student’s t test), with little further increase after 400 days (\\(P = 0.593\\), \\(F_{321} = 0.546\\), one-way ANOVA; Fig. 1d). Although PMs largely plateaued in cell aspect ratio and cluster size after 200 days (\\(P = 0.455\\) and 0.613, \\(F_{316} = 0.917\\) and 0.618, respectively, one-way ANOVA) following an initial increase (\\(P = 1.61 \\times 10^{-4}\\) and \\(8.27 \\times 10^{-5}\\), \\(t_s = 13.7\\) and 16.3, respectively, two-tailed one-sample Student’s t test, comparing 1200s and 10), the PAs displayed continuous increases in these two traits over the experiment (\\(P = 3.17 \\times 10^{-6}\\) and \\(5.12 \\times 10^{-7}\\), \\(r^2 = 0.67\\) and 0.73, respectively, linear regression; Fig. 1c,e).\n\nAs cell volume increased concomitantly with cell aspect ratio in both PMs and early PAs (Fig. 1d,e), we sought to disentangle their effects on cluster size, using our previously validated biophysical model\\(^8\\). We found that increased cell volume and aspect ratio both lead to larger clusters (Fig. 1f), but in mechanistically different ways: larger cells give rise to proportionally larger clusters without changing cell packing density or cell number per cluster, whereas longer cells reduce cell packing density and allow growing more cells per cluster (Fig. 1g,h). These results demonstrate how increases in cell volume and aspect ratio, two key cellular traits, contribute to the evolution of larger multicellular size in snowflake yeast through distinct biophysical mechanisms.\n\n## Origin and maintenance of polyploidy\n\nIn most organisms, WGD results in a twofold increase in cell volume\\(^9\\). We thus examined the ploidy of our yeast over the MuLTE. First, we sequenced the genomes of isolates from 1200 and beyond, and we found that most of their point mutations have allele frequencies centred around 0.25, with the others around 0.5, 0.75 or 1 (Fig. 2a), suggesting that they had evolved tetraploid genomes. To further validate this, we developed an imaging-based method for measuring ploidy levels of multicellular yeast strains (Extended Data Fig. 3a). As we used asynchronous, exponential-phase cultures for ploidy measurements, the distribution of cellular DNA contents of a single, clonal strain is expected to contain two peaks, corresponding to G1-phase and DNA-replicated G2-phase cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b). All evolved isolates have roughly double the genome size as their diploid ancestor, suggesting that they have undergone WGD (Fig. 2b). To trace the origin of tetraploidy, we measured ploidy distributions of populations from earlier time points, and we discovered that in all ten populations, tetraploidy had emerged and become dominant by 50 days, fixing by 100 days (Fig. 2c). Together, these results show that in all ten PM and PA lines, tetraploidy emerged very early in the MuLTE, and it has been maintained for over 950 transfers (and counting). Of note, although PMs were mainly euphold, PAs evolved extensive aneuploidy (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4). We examine the temporal dynamics (Fig. 2d) and evolutionary consequences (Figs. 4 and 5) of aneuploidy evolving after WGD in the section ‘Aneuploidy underpins macroscopic size’, focusing first on the evolution of WGD itself.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first evolution experiment in which polyploidy convergingly evolved from diploid ancestors. Although it has long been known that polyploidy can be mechanistically induced by physical or chemical treatment\\(^9\\), we did not use an experimental treatment that directly induces polyploidy. Moreover, the long-term persistence of polyploidy in our experiment (more than 4,750 generations) is in dramatic contrast to previous evolution experiments, where, under various conditions, tetraploidy was ancestors are economically unstable and typically converge to diploidy within a few hundred generations\\(^10,11,12,13,14\\). This raises the question regarding what drove the origin and maintenance of polyploidy in the MuLTE.\n\n## Polyploidy brings immediate size benefit\n\nIn unicellular \\(S. cerevisiae\\), increased ploidy increases both cell volume\\(^8\\) and cell aspect ratio\\(^9\\). In fact, increased cell size is a universal feature of polyploid cells across eukaryotes\\(^9\\). As increased cell volume and aspect ratio both contribute to larger snowflake yeast clusters (Fig. 1f), we hypothesize that tetraploidy arose in the MuLTE because\n\n===== Page 3 =====\n\nMulticellular ancestor (dipioid, ace2A)\n\nMixotropic (PM)  \nAnaerobic (PA)\n\nReplicate population 1–5\n\nSettling selection\n\nSample  \nSettle  \n\nLarger  \n\nTransfer, grow 1 day\n\nPM  \nPA  \n\n512  \n256  \n128  \n64  \n32  \n16  \n\nTime of evolution (days)\n\nCluster radius (μm²)\n\nCluster radius (μm²)\n\nCell volume (μm²)\n\nCell volume (μm²)\n\nTime of evolution (days)\n\nCluster cell number\n\nTime of evolution (days)\n\nCluster packing fraction\n\nCell aspect ratio\n\nCell aspect ratio\n\nCell volume (μm²)\n\nCell volume (μm²)\n\nFig. 1 | Increased cell volume and aspect ratio drive the evolution of larger multicellular groups in the I,000-day MuLTEE. a, Experimental setup of the MuLTEE. b, Representative cluster-level (top two rows) and cell-level (bottom two rows) images of the ancestor (10) and day I,000 (1I,000) isolates from the five replicate populations evolved under PM and PA conditions.

To test this, we genetically engineered tetraploidy in a dipioid snowflake yeast background (Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 1). Consistent with our hypothesis, under both mixotrophic and anaerobic conditions, tetraploid clusters consist of larger, more elongated cells and are larger than their dipioid counterparts (Fig. 3a–f and Extended Data Fig. 5b–e).\n\nand 1,288 cells (d,e) measured for each of the 42 strains), with the grey dotted and dashed lines representing artificially constructed dipioid and tetraploid strains (mean value of the four biological replicates in Fig. 3c,b,c), respectively. f-h, Heat maps showing the biophysical simulations of how cell volume and cell aspect ratio affect the mean cluster radius (f), cell number per cluster (g) and cell packing fraction (fraction of the cluster volume occupied by cells; h) of clusters at fragmentation (n = 50 simulated clusters per pair of parameter values).\n\nNext, we compared the engineered tetraploids with the evolved isolates to see how much of the phenotypic changes in the MuLTEE can be explained by tetraploidization alone. In PMs, engineering tetraploidy alone recapitulated the increases in cluster size, cell volume and cell aspect ratio over the first 1,000 days of the MuLTEE (Fig. 1c–e). In PAs, tetraploidy contributed to most of the cell volume increase in the first 200 days of the experiment (Fig. 1d), as well as most of the increases in cluster size and cell aspect ratio in the first 50 days (Extended Data\n\nNature | www.nature.com | 3\n\n===== Page 4 =====\n\n# Article\n\n## Title\n- **Fig. 2 | Tetraploidy rapidly emerged and was maintained in all PMs and PAs; PAs subsequently evolved extensive aneuploidy.**  \n- **a**, Violin plot of the distribution of allele frequencies (each determined as the proportion of reads containing the mutant allele) of novel point mutations identified in PM/PA1–5 t200, t400, t600 and t1,000 isolates, with each dot representing one point mutation.  \n- **b**, Evolutionary dynamics of DNA content, showing that of PM/PA to and the strains used in panel a (on average, \\( n = 11 \\), 456 cells measured for each of the 42 strains).  \n- **c**, Ridge plot of the distribution of cellular DNA contents in the PM/PA to and PM/PA1–5 t50 and t100 populations (on average, \\( n = 12 \\), 922 cells measured for each of the 22 populations).

However, tetraploidy alone does not explain the subsequent increases in cluster size and cell aspect ratio in PAs (Fig. 1c,e).\n\nTo examine whether tetraploidy indeed confers an immediate fitness benefit under selection for larger size, we competed engineered diploid and tetraploid clusters with and without settling selection, using a label-free fitness assay (Extended Data Fig. 6). Supporting our hypothesis, under both mixotrophic and anaerobic conditions, settling selection strongly favoured tetraploidy (Fig. 3g), increasing its average frequency from 53% to 82% within 3 days.\n\n---\n\n### Selection for larger size drives polyploidy\n\nOur results above suggest that tetraploidy evolved as a mechanism of increasing group size. To test this more directly, we re-evolved the MuLTEE ancestors with selection acting in the opposite direction. This was achieved by growing our yeast on solid media (Extended Data Fig. 7a), a condition known to favour smaller groups\\(^{38}\\). We evolved the PM and PA ancestors, each with four replicate populations, on agar with daily dilutions for 70 days (approximately 500 generations). All populations remained predominantly diploid (Fig. 3h). This is markedly different from the MuLTEE, in which tetraploid strains became dominant within the first 50 days (approximately 250 generations) of settling selection (Fig. 2c).\n\nAlthough tetraploidy initially evolved as a mechanism to increase group size in our experiment, nascent tetraploidy, especially in S. cerevisiae, is notoriously unstable\\(^{21,14,35,36}\\). What explains its maintenance over nearly 5,000 generations in the MuLTEE is still unknown. We have two central hypotheses: tetraploidy may be actively maintained by selection for larger size, or molecular mechanisms could have evolved that stabilize the duplicated genomes, like in Lu et al.\\(^{16}\\).\n\nTo disentangle these hypotheses, we performed a similar reverse selection experiment, evolving the tetraploid t1,000 isolates with selection against larger size. We evolved the ten PM and PA t1,000 isolates, each with four replicate populations, on solid media with daily transfers for 70 days (approximately 500 generations; Extended Data Fig. 7a), and most populations indeed evolved reduced cluster size (Extended Data Fig. 7b). In total, 22 of 40 evolved populations exhibited ploidy reduction, including nine populations that reverted to a genome size similar to the diploid ancestor (Fig. 3i). Furthermore, ploidy reductions were observed in 8 of 10 genetically distinct t1,000 isolates (Fig. 3i). These results suggest that the long-term maintenance of tetraploidy over the MuLTEE was due to sustained selection for larger size. Of note, the presence of intermediate ploidy levels (approximately 3N) in multiple evolved populations (Fig. 3i) suggests that the ploidy reductions were probably mediated by non-melotic chromosome losses (like in Gerstein et al.\\(^{13,35}\\)). Although we cannot rule out the contribution of meiosis to ploidy reduction, we do not expect it to have a major role: PAs are\n\n===== Page 5 [text layer] =====\n\nNature | www.nature.com | 5\nmitochondrial petites and thus cannot sporulate39, and sporulation in \nPMs is rare when growing on rich media.\nTo further test whether polyploidy arises and persists in the MuLTEE \nas the result of selection, rather than intrinsic genomic properties of our \nyeast that favour genome duplication and maintenance, we performed \na mutation accumulation experiment. By repeatedly passaging popula-\ntions through single-cell bottlenecks, mutation accumulation experi-\nments allow evolution to proceed in the near-absence of selection, \nrevealing the inherent tendencies of genomic changes. We passaged \nthree replicate populations for each of the diploid PM and PA ances-\ntors, all five of their t1,000 isolates, and engineered tetraploid strains \nthrough 28 consecutive single-colony bottlenecks over 56 days. The \ngenome size of the ancestors remained generally constant, whereas at \nleast one replicate population of engineered tetraploids and 8 of 10 of \ntetraploid t1,000 isolates underwent considerable ploidy reduction \n(Cohen’s d > 0.8) by approximately 0.5–1N (Fig. 3j and Extended Data \nFig. 8), indicative of non-meiotic chromosome losses. These results \ndemonstrate that the diploid ancestors have no intrinsic tendency for \ntetraploidization, whereas the evolved tetraploids remained genomi-\ncally unstable and prone to ploidy reduction, further underscoring \nthat selection for larger size (Fig. 3a–i) is the main driver of the rise \nand maintenance of polyploidy in the MuLTEE.\na\nd\nP = 3.94 × 10–8\nP = 2 × 10–4\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nCell volume (μm3)\nb\nP = 0.000132\nP = 1.7 × 10–6\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\nCluster radius (μm)\n2N\n4N\n2N\n4N\n2N\n4N\ne\nP = 1.62 × 10–5\nP = 4.81 × 10–5\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\nCell aspect ratio\nc\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n50\n100\n150\nCell volume (μm3)\nCell aspect ratio\n2N\n4N\nf\nP = 0.000369\nP = 0.00307\n−0.25\n0\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n4N versus 2N\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\nSelection rate (per day)\nSettling selection\nWith\nWithout\ng\nt0 (2N)\nt1,000 (4N)\nEngineered 4N\nPM\nPA\nPM\nPA\n−1N\n−0.5N\n0\n0.5N\nPloidy change\n(re-evolve with minimal selection)\nPloidy\nUp\nSmall change\nDown\nj\nPM t0\nPA t0\n0\n2N 4N 6N 8N 10N\n0\n2N 4N 6N 8N 10N\nD\nC\nB\nA\nAnc\nRe-evolve t0s under selection against larger size\nRe-evolve t1,000 isolates under selection against larger size\nDNA content\nReplicate\npopulation\nEvolved ploidy\n~2N\nh\nPM t1,000\nPA t1,000\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n2N 4N 6N 8N 10N\n0\n2N 4N 6N 8N 10N\nD\nC\nB\nA\nAnc\nD\nC\nB\nA\nAnc\nD\nC\nB\nA\nAnc\nD\nC\nB\nA\nAnc\nD\nC\nB\nA\nAnc\nDNA content\nReplicate population\nEvolved ploidy\n~2N\n2N-4N\n~4N\ni\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\n2N\n4N\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\n2N\n4N\nMixotrophic\nAnaerobic\nFig. 3 | Tetraploidy confers immediate phenotypic effects that are beneficial \nunder selection for larger size, driving the origin and maintenance of \ntetraploidy despite its genomic instability. a,d, Cell-level (a) and cluster-level \n(d) images of the engineered diploid and tetraploid clusters under mixotrophic \nand anaerobic conditions.

The boxes denote the interquartile range (IQR), the centre except PA3), these complex karyotypes stayed remarkably conserved between t600 and t1,000 in each line (Fig. 2d). The exception, PA5, in which considerably different karyotypes were observed between its t600 and t1,000 isolates (Fig. 2d), also displayed substantially different cluster sizes and cell aspect ratios between them (Fig. 1c,e). These observations suggest that aneuploidy might have had a critical role in the evolution of macroscopic size in PAs.\n\nTo test this hypothesis more directly, we used a forward-genetics approach, selecting for losses of macroscopic size in evolved isolates and examining whether karyotype changes are involved. This is enabled by our accidental finding that changes in colony morphology offer a convenient marker for screening spontaneous losses of macroscopic size: all macroscopic PA isolates typically form ring-shaped colonies (‘donut’ colonies), interspersed with rare, larger, flattened colonies (‘spread’ colonies) that can no longer form macroscopic clusters when cultured in liquid media (Fig. 4a). We randomly selected three donut colonies from each of the nine macroscopic PA t600 and t1,000 isolates (excluding the still microscopic PA3 t600 isolate) and then isolated one spread colony derived from each donut colony. All spread strains had dramatically reduced cluster size, no longer forming macroscopic clusters (Fig. 4b). Consistent with the previously demonstrated effects of cell-level traits on cluster size, the donut-to-spread transitions were associated with overall decreases in cell volume and, more significantly and consistently, in cell aspect ratio (Fig. 4c–f).\n\nTo identify the genetic changes underlying the spontaneous losses of macroscopic size, we sequenced and compared the genomes of each donut–spread pair. We found no strong statistical evidence that point mutation changes had a systematic role in this process (Extended Data\n\n---\n\n## Aneuploidy underpins macroscopic size\n\nPolyploidy is associated with much higher rates of aneuploidy than diploidy\\(^{40-42}\\). Nascent polyploids tend to rapidly undergo genome reduction, and the resulting aneuploidy can offer a novel genetic route for rapid adaptation to novel environments\\(^{22,25}\\). However, it remains untested whether polyploids, when maintained, can also adapt by generating aneuploidy. The MuLTEE, with its long-term maintenance of polyploidy, presents a unique system to directly test this hypothesis. Consistent with the instability of tetraploid genomes, we observed cases of aneuploidy (Fig. 2d) and segmental aneuploidy (Extended Data Fig. 4) in the evolved isolates in the MuLTEE. Of note, although PMs were euploid or near-euploid, PAs displayed extensive aneuploidy (Fig. 2d). This distinction is correlated with their divergent multicellular evolution over 1,000 days: whereas PMs remained microscopic, PAs evolved macroscopic size (Fig. 1c). We thus hypothesize that the evolved aneuploidy in PAs might have contributed to their origin of macroscopic multicellular size, arguably the most striking phenotypic innovation that has evolved in the MuLTEE so far.\n\nParallel changes in aneuploidy and multicellular size in PAs over the MuLTEE suggest a potential link between the two. The level of aneuploidy in PAs generally increased over evolution (linear regression against time for number of aneuploid chromosomes, total number of chromosome copies deviating from euploid tetraploidy, and coefficient of variation of chromosome copy numbers, \\(P = 0.023\\), 0.017 and and 0.020, \\(r^2 = 0.10\\), 0.11 and 0.11, respectively; Fig. 2d), mirroring the trends in cluster size and cell aspect ratio (Fig. 1c,e).

By contrast, 24 of 25 donut-to-spread transitions were associated with Karyotype changes (Fig. 5a,b). Two spread strains in PA4 even lost almost an entire set of chromosomes and partially triploidized (Fig. 5a,b). We excluded these two extreme cases from subsequent analyses, due to their divergence from our otherwise tetraploid background and confounding effect of dramatically decreased DNA content. Karyotype changes in spread strains were mostly limited to copy number changes in one to two chromosomes (Fig. 5d), and among the 53 chromosome copy number changes in total, all but two changed by only one copy (Fig. 5b).\n\nSurprisingly, despite the numerous ways that karyotypes could potentially change, we observed six cases of convergent Karyotype changes among just 23 donut–spread pairs (\\(P = 8.24 \\times 10^{-6}\\)), probability of observing six or more cases with identical karyotype changes, each with changes in no more than two chromosomes, assuming equal probability of gains and losses of each of the 16 chromosomes; Fig. 5b). Three of these six cases even involved donut–spread pairs derived from different genetic backgrounds (either different evolutionary time points in the same line or different lines; Fig. 5b). Most of these convergent karyotype changes were also associated with similar changes in cell volume and aspect ratio (Fig. 5c), suggesting a link between karyotype changes and phenotypic changes. Moreover, we also observed convergent changes in the copy numbers of certain chromosomes across donut-to-spread transitions (Fig. 5f), and strikingly, each chromosome (except for chromosome III) that underwent copy number changes always changed in the same direction across all spread strains (that is, a chromosome was either always gained or always lost; Fig. 5g). This is most clearly reflected in chromosomes VIII and XIV, which were convergently lost in almost half of all spread strains involving all five PA lines (\\(P = 6.28 \\times 10^{-7}\\) and \\(5.05 \\times 10^{-6}\\), respectively, binomial probability of observing 11 or more, or 10 or more losses of any given chromosome among 53 chromosome copy number changes, assuming equal probability of gains and losses of each of the 16 chromosomes; Fig. 5f,g). Together, the prevalent and convergent changes at the karyotype and chromosome level during donut-to-spread transitions, as well as their correlations with phenotypic changes, strongly suggest that changes in aneuploidy underpin the spontaneous losses of macroscopic size.\n\nTo investigate the role of aneuploidy in the evolution of macroscopic size in the MuLTEE, we compared the chromosome copy number changes associated with the emergence of macroscopic size during the MuLTEE to those involved in the spontaneous loss of macroscopic size in the donut-to-spread transitions. We first identified the candidate chromosomes that are directly involved in the evolution of macroscopic size in each line, by identifying the chromosomes with copy number\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\n# Article\n\nchanges that are absent in any of the microscopic isolates (t200 and t400, and for PA3, also t600) but present in at least one of the macroscopic isolates (t600 and t1,000). This yields one set of candidate chromosomes for each of the nine macroscopic isolates (Fig. 5c, shown as diamonds). Of note, for 13 of 18 candidate chromosomes (exceptions are mostly within PA5), the evolutionary changes of their copy numbers observed in the t600 isolate were maintained in the t1,000 isolate of the same line (Fig. 5c). Among the 53 chromosome copy number changes in all donut-to-spread transitions (Fig. 5c, shown as bars), 20 occurred in the candidate chromosomes of the corresponding isolate background (Fig. 5c, indicated by lines connecting diamonds and bars). Of these, all changed in the opposite direction to their evolutionary changes in the MuLTEE (Fig. 5c, contrasting colours between diamonds and bars connected by lines), suggesting that the copy number changes of these candidate chromosomes contributed to the evolution of macroscopic size. If these changes were due to intrinsic mutational biases, we would expect that they would show consistent directionality. Instead, their opposing patterns during the evolution of macroscopic size in the MuLTEE versus the donut-to-spread transitions suggest that they were the result of selection.\n\nFurthermore, when comparing across the five PA lines, we found that some candidate chromosomes and their directions of copy number changes over evolution are shared among multiple lines (for example, chromosomes VIII, IX and XIV), whereas the other candidate chromosomes are more line specific (Fig. 5h,i). In the donut-to-spread transitions, all the chromosomes (candidate or not) that changed copy numbers in more than one spread strain changed consistently in the opposite direction to their evolutionary changes (comparing Fig. 5g and Fig. 5i). As the copy numbers of some candidate chromosomes can rapidly change in the donut-to-spread transitions, their maintenance from t600 to t1,000 isolates in the MuLTEE suggest that, just like polyploidy, at least some part of the evolved aneuploidy was maintained by sustained selection for larger multicellular size despite its intrinsic instability.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe MuLTEE was initially designed to study the open-ended evolution of increasingly complex multicellular life. Our results reveal that the MuLTEE also serves as a unique polyploidy long-term evolution experiment, providing direct empirical insights into the short-term and long-term evolutionary dynamics of nascent WGDs. We found that tetraploidy evolved in our system due to its immediate phenotypic effects, producing larger, longer cells that give rise to larger multicellular clusters, which is adaptive under our selection regime. Despite its intrinsic genomic instability, tetraploidy was maintained over thousands of generations by sustained selection for larger organismal size. Furthermore, we discovered that extensive, convergently evolving and evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy had a key role in the subsequent evolution of macroscopic multicellularity in our model system.\n\nOur results have several important implications for understanding the evolution of WGD. First, we show that nascent polyploidy is not necessarily transient, even before the evolution of genome-stabilizing mechanisms. WGD has long been known to bring immediate phenotypic changes, many stemming from increased cell size (a universal feature of polyploid cells and central to evolved polyploids in the MuLTEE), which can confer fitness benefits under novel environments \\(^{12,23,20,21}\\). Here we have experimentally demonstrated that selection favouring the immediate phenotypic effects of WGD is sufficient to drive both its origin and maintenance, despite the intrinsic instability of polyploid genomes. As a result, the duration of the environment favouring polyploidy may be a key determinant of whether a nascent WGD will be transient or persistent. This may also explain the increased abundance of polyploids in certain environments \\(^{14,15}\\) (for example, tetraploid yeast in bakeries\\(^{16}\\)). Unlike cases in which genome-stabilizing mechanisms evolve, the polyploid genomes actively maintained under environmental selection can still be intrinsically unstable, rapidly reverting towards diploidy in the absence of the polyploidy-favouring selection.\n\nBuilding on previous works showing that WGD can profoundly influence evolutionary dynamics by altering the rate, spectrum and fitness effect of mutations \\(^{24,14,25}\\), our experiment is the first to directly examine how recently duplicated genomes evolve when polyploidy is maintained over long evolutionary timescales. In the MuLTEE, we found that the point mutations arising in the polyploid background are highly heterozygous. Some mutations can reach high allele frequencies (more than 0.75) within individual genomes, which may be the result of positive selection given evidence of extensive gene conversion in our system (Supplementary Note 1). We also found that polyploidy, even when maintained, can still exhibit genomic instability and generate aneuploidy, exploring novel karyotypic space and facilitating long-term adaptation. Moreover, our findings challenge a previous notion that aneuploidy necessarily serves as a temporary solution to novel environments \\(^{40,45}\\). Instead, we demonstrate that even complex aneuploid karyotypes can be maintained for thousands of generations, despite the inherent instability of aneuploid genomes. The polyploid background in our system may also facilitate the maintenance of aneuploidy by better tolerating its potential costs through reduced gene dosage effects \\(^{2,3}\\). Our observation also offers an alternative explanation for the aneuploidy frequently found in natural polyploids \\(^{46}\\), rather than being a transient, non-adaptive consequence of genomic instability, in some cases they may be the result of selection, preserved over long timescales when the selective environment remains stable.\n\nAlthough previous work has revealed the adaptive roles of aneuploidy in promoting stress resistance and virulence \\(^{40,41}\\), our results show that aneuploidy can also contribute to the evolution of morphological innovations (that is, macroscopic multicellularity), expanding its functional repertoire. Further work will be required to explore the mechanistic basis of how aneuploidy drives this phenotypic change. Possible mechanisms may include gene dosage effects and epistatic interactions between structural variations and point mutations. From an evolutionary perspective, it will be interesting to examine whether the divergent karyotypes evolved and maintained in different PA lines result from historical contingency and represented local fitness optima in the karyotypic space. In addition, it is worth investigating why the aneuploidy in PMs is limited. PMs do not appear to be constrained, however, in their intrinsic capacity of generating aneuploidy, as most PM t1,000 isolates underwent rapid ploidy reduction in our counter-selection and mutation accumulation experiments (Fig. 3i,j). The near-euploidy in PMs may instead be because the evolution of increased multicellular size is constrained under this condition \\(^{8,9}\\), and aneuploidy is selected against if its benefits do not outweigh its costs \\(^{46}\\).\n\nThe MuLTEE is now the longest-running evolution experiment not just in the evolution of multicellularity, but also in the evolution of polyploidy, offering direct empirical insights into how WGDs can arise, persist and drive short-term and long-term adaptation. We anticipate that this open-ended, multi-condition, long-term evolution experiment will continue to serve as a source of inspiration and a testbed for various hypotheses regarding WGD, a fundamental process in eukaryotic evolution.\n\n## Online content\n\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08689-6.\n\n1 Otto, S.

In brief, we constructed a multicellular diploid \\(S. cerevisiae\\) strain from a unicellular diploid YSS strain by ACE2 deletion. From this grande strain, which grows both aerobically and anaerobically in YPD media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% dextrose), we isolated a spontaneous petite mutant that grows anaerobically in YPD media even in the presence of oxygen. We confirmed the anaerobic phenotype of the petite mutant by showing that it cannot grow on glycerol and does not consume oxygen during growth using direct oxygen measurements. We evolved five replicate populations of mixotrophic and anaerobic snowflake yeast (referred to as PMI–5 and PAI–5, respectively) with daily selection for increased size over 1,000 days. Every day, we grew each population in 10 ml of YPD media at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 24 h, and then we transferred 1.5 ml of the culture into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, let clusters settle on the bench for 3 min and transferred the bottom 50 µl into 10 ml of fresh YPD media for the next day of growth. Once PAI–5 evolved macroscopic clusters that settle rapidly, we used wide-bore pipette tips to minimize breaking clusters during pipetting, and we also decreased the settling time to 30 s to allow sustained selection for increased size, with this change occurring on approximately 350 days for PA2 and PA5 and approximately 500 days for PAI, PA3 and PA4. For simplicity, starting from day 850, we sampled 1 ml, instead of 1.5 ml, from each culture for daily settling selection. We archived a glycerol stock for each population every 10–15 days. We extracted one representative clonal isolate from each of the ten populations archived on days 200, 400, 600 and 1,000 for subsequent analyses.\n\n### Measuring cluster size\nWe revived strains from glycerol stocks by growing them on YPD plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Then, we inoculated each strain into 10 ml of YPD media and grew them at 30 °C with 250 rpm shaking for 3 days with daily settling selection before transferring to fresh media, recapitulating how the strains grow during the evolution experiment. On the last day, after settling selection and transfer, we grew the cultures for 24 h and sampled them at 4 h (exponential phase) and 24 h (stationary phase) for measuring cluster size. Unless otherwise noted, the 24-h measurements are used throughout the paper, as they represent the states of the cultures right before settling selection.\n\nBefore imaging, we gently shook each culture by hand (without vortexing, which may break clusters) and added an appropriate volume of the culture (1–250 µl, depending on cluster density) into H\\(_2\\)O containing 10 µl of 16% (w/v) formaldehyde (28906, Thermo Scientific) in a 24-well plate, making up 510 µl per well. For macroscopic strains, we sampled the culture using manually cut wide-bore 1-ml tips to avoid breaking macroscopic clusters during pipetting, and we typically sampled twice from each culture and transferred them into two wells to reduce the randomness in sampling macroscopic clusters. We gently shook the 24-well plate to evenly spread out the clusters and allowed 5–10 min for clusters to settle down.\n\nWe used a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (NIS-Elements v4.30.01) to scan the whole wells by taking and stitching 5 × 8 bright-field, shading-corrected images with 10% overlap at x4 magnification, scanning at 1 mm s\\(^{-1}\\). We developed a semi-automated image analysis pipeline using ImageJ (v1.54f) to (1) segment clusters using autolocal thresholding (which allows detecting clusters ranging from tiny branches to macroscopic clusters) and split touching clusters using seed-based watershed, (2) perform manual correction using a custom, user-friendly toolkit for improving the speed and reproducibility of manual correction, and (3) measure the cross-sectional area of each cluster. We removed segmented objects with an area below 40 µm\\(^2\\).\n\nUsing R (v4.1.2), we converted cluster areas to cluster volumes and radiuses, treating clusters as perfect spheres. For each strain, we calculated its biomass-weighted mean cluster radius\\(^8\\) by first calculating its mean cluster volume weighted by cluster volume and then converting it to radius.\n\n### Measuring cell volume and aspect ratio\nWe revived strains from glycerol stocks by growing them on YPD plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Then, we inoculated each strain into 10 ml of YPD media and grew them at 30 °C with 250 rpm shaking for 3 days with daily settling selection before transferring to fresh media. On the last day, we transferred 100 µl of culture (without settling selection) to 10 ml of fresh media and grew it for 12 h, following Bozdag et al.\\(^8\\), 10 m. To prepare samples for imaging, we transferred 25 µl of each culture to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. For macroscopic strains, we sampled the culture using 100-µl wide-bore tips to allow pipetting macroscopic clusters, and we broke clusters into tiny pieces by pipetting with 100-µl regular-bore tips to facilitate crushing them into a single layer of cells later. We pelleted the clusters by spinning at 5,000g for 1 min, washed them with 1 ml of N PBS, and incubated them in 100 µl of 5 µM Calcofluor White (a blue fluorescent cell wall stain) in N PBS at room temperature. We gently crushed 5 µl of stained clusters (without shearing, which can lose cells) into a single layer of cells between a microscope slide and a coverslip.\n\nWe used a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (NIS-Elements v4.30.01) to take brightfield and fluorescent (UV channel) images of at least five fields of view (FOVs) per strain at x40 magnification. For each FOV, we set the focus based on the bright field channel by manually moving to a 2-plane where cells look grey (rather than brighter or darker) and then moving down by 0.7 µm to get sharp fluorescent signals of the cell wall. We developed a semi-automated image analysis pipeline using Cellpose (v2.2.2)\\(^{9/2}\\) and ImageJ (v1.54f) to perform (1) automated cell segmentation using Cellpose (specify cell diameter as 80 pixels for images with 0.073 µm per pixel), (2) GPL provided by Georgia Tech’s Phoenix Cluster, (2) manual correction using Cellpose’s Graphical User Interface (GUI), and (3) measurement of the area, lengths of major and minor axis, aspect ratio, and solidity of each cell in ImageJ. We removed segmented objects with an area below 1 µm\\(^2\\) or a solidity below 0.8. Using R (v4.1.2), we calculated cell volumes using the formula \\(V = 4/3 \\times \\text{rad} / \\text{(treating yeast cells as perfect ellipsoids)}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the major and minor axis of each cell, respectively.\n\n### Biophysical simulation\nWe adapted our previously published biophysical model\\(^8,13\\) to disentangle and elucidate the effects of cell volume and cell aspect ratio on cluster size. In our model, we added new cells (modelled as prolate ellipsoids) in the characteristic snowflake yeast budding pattern until a certain total amount of overlap between cells is reached (representing the threshold for cluster fragmentation), whereupon the simulation is terminated. Using this model, we swept through a range of overlap thresholds to find a value that recapitulated our empirical data. Then, using that value, we swept through a range of cell volumes (from 25 to 250 µm\\(^3\\)) and aspect ratios (from 1 to 2). We simulated 50 clusters at each pair of parameter values, and measured cluster volume (estimated by the volume of the convex hull bounding the cluster), cell number and packing fraction of each simulated cluster upon fragmentation.\n\n### Whole-genome sequencing and analysis\nTo sequence yeast genomes, we first extracted yeast genomic DNA using WWRs DNA purification kit. Genomic library preparation using the Illumina DNA Prep kit and sequencing using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and NovaSeq X Plus sequencer with 150-bp paired-end reads were performed by the Microbial Sequencing Center at the University of Pittsburgh. We obtained FASTQ files of genome reads at an average coverage of 160X.\n\n===== Page 11 =====\n\nTo analyse the genome reads, we first filtered and trimmed low-quality reads using Trimmomatic (v0.39). Next, we aligned the reads to the S288C reference genome\\(^{48}\\)(R64-3-I build) using BWA-MEM (v0.7.17)\\(^{49}\\). Following GATK's Best Practices pipeline\\(^{50}\\), we generated binary alignment files (BAM) and marked duplicates using Picard Toolkit (v2.27.5). Next, we used GATK Haplotypecaller (v4.2.4.1) to call for variants. To filter out variants with low genotype quality, we used VCF TOOLS (v0.1.16)\\(^{51}\\). Next, we extracted novel mutations that are only present in the evolved genomes by comparing them against the ancestral genome via bcftools-isec (v1.10)\\(^{52}\\). Finally, we annotated novel mutations using snpEff (v5.0)\\(^{53}\\) (including assigning mutation impacts as high, moderate, low or modifier) and calculated their allele frequencies by dividing the read depth of the mutant allele with the total read depth in each particular position.\n\nTo determine the karyotype of each strain, we first computed the read depth of each base position (base coverage) in the genome using Banttools Stats (v2.5.1) and then estimated chromosome copy numbers in R (v4.1.2). Specifically, we calculated the mean base coverage in each 1-kb non-overlapping bin along each chromosome (bin coverage), and then normalized the bin coverages in each genome by dividing it with the median bin coverage in the whole genome. Next, we calculated bin copy number by multiplying the normalized bin coverage with the baseline ploidy level of the strain (determined by imaging-based ploidy measurement below). Finally, we estimated the copy number of each chromosome as its rounded median bin copy number.\n\nFor donut and spread strains, we also estimated mutation allele copy number in R (v4.1.2), using mutation allele frequency and chromosome copy number calculated above. For amutation with its corresponding chromosome having copy number \\(N\\), its allele copy number would be 0 or \\(N\\) if its allele frequency is 0 or 1, respectively. For other values of allele frequency, we estimated the mutation allele copy number (\\(C\\)) as the integer between 1 and \\(N-1\\) where \\(C/N\\) is the closest to the allele frequency. In cases of ties (observed in 7 of 2,003 mutations in 46 donut and spread strains), we chose the allele copy number that has the least change from the other strain in the corresponding donut-spread pair. We also used \\(C/N\\) as the corrected allele frequency.\n\nTo calculate the distribution of mutation impacts of a point mutation randomly introduced into the yeast genome (S288C reference genome, R64-3-I build), we only considered single-nucleotide substitutions, as multi-nucleotide substitutions and indels are much rarer and were not observed in the mutations that were gained in donut-to-spread transitions. We calculated the probability of the random mutation having high, moderate, low or modifier impacts as the probability of it being a nonsense, missense, synonymous or intronic, or non-coding/intronic mutation.\n\n### Yeast strain construction\n\nTo construct isogenic grande diploid and tetraploid snowflake yeast, we started with two S. cerevisiae grande haploid unicellular strains (MATA hola:hphNT1 and MATA hola:hphNT1), derived from the Y55 background (from which the MuLTE ancestors were also derived). We first deleted the ACE2 open reading frame from these two haploid strains using a kanMX cassette, which made them multicellular, and then mated them to form a grande diploid strain (a/α). Next, we transformed this diploid strain with a pGALL-HO-tADHI-natNT2 plasmid containing CEN/ARS elements, and then transiently induced HO expression by galactose to switch the mating type from a/α to a/a and α/α (determined by a halo assay), followed by selection for plasmid loss. We then mated the a/a and α/α diploid strains to form a grande tetraploid strain (a/a/α/α).\n\nTo generate petite diploid and tetraploid snowflake yeast, we isolated spontaneous petite mutants from the grande diploid and tetraploid strains, respectively, by selecting colonies that are smaller than normal colonies on a YPD plate (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose and 1.5% agar) and cannot grow on a YP-glycerol plate (the same as the YPD plate but with the dextrose replaced by 2.5% glycerol). As petite mutation is not isogenic, we isolated four independent petite mutants per strain, each of which is derived from a different single colony of the parental grande strain.\n\n### Imaging-based ploidy measurement of snowflake yeast\n\nCommon protocols for ploidy measurement of unicellular yeast are based on flow cytometry of DNA-stained single cells, in which fluorescent intensity of the DNA stain such as propidium iodide scales linearly with DNA content\\(^{1534}\\). However, these protocols cannot be readily applied to multicellular yeast without an efficient method for dissociating clusters into single cells, so we developed an imaging-based protocol for measuring the ploidy level of snowflake yeast strains. Basically, we used fluorescent images of propidium iodide-stained, flattened clusters to quantify the propidium iodide intensity of GI-phase nuclei, which was compared with strains with known ploidy to estimate the DNA content of the focal strain.\n\nWe adapted the sample preparation procedure before fluorescent imaging from Todd et al.\\(^{54}\\). In every experiment, two control strains with known ploidy, namely, the engineered grande diploid and tetraploid snowflake yeast, also went through the same procedure of sample preparation and imaging. We first grew each strain of interest in YPD media to mid-log phase, and then transferred 250 μl of the culture into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. We pelleted the clusters by spinning at 5,000g for 1 min and washed them with 1 ml of H\\(_2\\)O. For macroscopic strains, we broke the clusters into small pieces by pipetting vigorously using 100-μl regular-bore tips before washing. We fixed and permeabilized the cells in 1 ml of 70% ethanol at room temperature for 2 h with end-to-end rotation on a mini-rotator (Bio RS-24, BioSan) at the maximum speed, followed by washing with 1 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate twice. We resuspended the clusters in 200 μl of 50 mM sodium citrate containing 0.5 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\) RNase A (101076, MP Biomedicals) and incubated them in a 37°C heat block for 2 h with gentle inversion every 30 min (as clusters settle over time). After RNA digestion, we added 5 μl of 1 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\) propidium iodide (P130AMP, Thermo Fisher) and incubated the mixture in a 30°C incubator in dark overnight with rotation on a mini-rotator (Bio RS-24, BioSan) at the minimum speed to keep clusters from settling. Propidium iodide-stained clusters can be stored at 4°C for no longer than 1 week before imaging.\n\nFor fluorescent imaging, we crushed 5 μl of propidium iodide-stained clusters into a single layer of cells between a microscope slide and a coverslip. For each sample, we took 14-bit images of approximately 10 FOVs at <20 magnification using a Nikon Eclipse Tinyerted microscope (NIS-Elements v4.30.01). For each FOV, we set the focus by manually moving to a z-plane in which cells look grey (rather than brighter or darker) in the bright field channel and then moving down by 1 μm to get sharp fluorescent signals of the nuclei. We imaged the flattened clusters in the red fluorescent channel (exposure of 600 ms and gain of 2.2×) at the focal plane as well as one z-plane 0.3 μm above and below the focal plane (three z-planes in total) to detect the propidium iodide-stained nuclei, and then imaged in the bright field channel (exposure of 100 ms and gain of 4.1×) at the focal plane. We set the exposure and gain of the fluorescent channel such that the brightest pixels in the tetraploid control strain are approximately 80% of the maximal allowed pixel value while minimizing photobleaching and noise.\n\nWe performed quantitative image analysis using ImageJ (v1.54f). We first performed maximum intensity projection of the three z-planes taken in the fluorescent channel and used the resulting image for segmentation and fluorescence quantification. We segmented nuclei and filtered them to include only single round nuclei. We measured the total propidium iodide fluorescence intensity of each nucleus with background subtraction, in which the background fluorescence is the median propidium iodide fluorescence intensity of the cytoplasm in the cluster that the focal nucleus is in. The resulting nuclear propidium iodide intensity scales linearly with the DNA content.\n\n===== Page 12 =====\n\n# Article\n\nWe analysed the image analysis results in R (v4.1.2). For each sample, we removed tiny segmented objects with areas two median absolute deviations below median (which are nucleus segmentation artefacts), and we manually removed FOVs with outlier distributions of nuclear propidium iodide intensity. The distribution of nuclear propidium iodide intensity in a clonal strain contains two peaks that correspond to G1-phase and G2-phase cells. We estimated the DNA content of each nucleus by dividing its propidium iodide intensity with the propidium iodide intensity of a haploid genome, which was estimated by averaging across the two ploidy control strains, that is, mean(G1 peak intensity of diploid control strain/2, G1 peak intensity of tetraploid control strain/4). We estimated the DNA content of a clonal strain as the DNA content of its G1 peak.\n\n## Competition assay\n\nTo perform competition assays between the engineered diploid and tetraploid snowflake yeast without fluorescent labelling (which may incur fitness cost), we developed an imaging-based method for distinguishing clusters with different ploidy levels, utilizing the fact that tetraploid clusters contain larger cells than diploid counterparts. Specifically, before imaging, we transferred an appropriate volume (12–18 µl, depending on cluster density) of the culture containing diploid and tetraploid clusters into a 24-well plate with 500 µl of H\\(_2\\)O per well. We gently shook the 24-well plate to evenly spread out the clusters and allowed 5–10 min for clusters to settle down. To image the centre of each well, we used a Nikon Eclipse TJ inverted microscope (NIS-Elements v4.30.01) to take and stitch 6 × 6 bright field, shading-corrected images with 5% overlap at x20 magnification, scanning at 1 mm s\\(^{-1}\\). We imaged at three z-planes, including the z-plane where the cells touching the well bottom look slightly bright, as well as 5 µm and 10 µm above it. Using ImageJ (v1.53q), we first segmented the clusters using the middle z-plane (with manual correction), and then we segmented the bright cells in the cluster edges in all three z-planes, thus capturing cells in different focal planes. Next, for each cluster, we calculated the mean area of the five largest cells detected across all three z-planes. This value is sufficient to distinguish the engineered diploid and tetraploid clusters in either grande or petite form, with the cut-off determined in a preliminary test.\n\nTo compete the engineered diploid and tetraploid snowflake yeast under mixotrophic and anaerobic conditions, we competed grande diploid versus grande tetraploid with four biological replicates, and we paired the four diploid and tetraploid petite mutants to form four competing pairs as our four replicates. We first revived the strains from glycerol stocks by growing them on YPD plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Then, we inoculated four replicate tubes for each grandest stain (diploid and tetraploid) as well as one replicate tube for each petite mutant (diploid and tetraploid), and we grew them in 10 ml of YPD media at 30 °C with 250 rpm shaking for 2 days with daily i:100 dilution. To start the competition of each of the eight competing pairs, we mixed 500 µl of the 24-h culture of each competing strain (1 ml in total), from which we inoculated 100 µl into 10 ml of YPD media in each of two culture tubes and grew them for 3 days, transferring daily with and without settling selection, respectively. For competitions with settling selection, we recapitulated the settling selection scheme in the MuLTEE: every day, we transferred 1.5 ml of each 24-h culture into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, let clusters settle for 3 min and transferred the bottom 50 µl into 10 ml of YPD media to grow for another day. For competitions without settling selection, we grew each culture with daily i:100 dilution. We measured the ratio of the total cluster volume in each competing strain at the start and the end of the 3-day competition, using the above imaging-based method to distinguish diploid and tetraploid clusters. Finally, we calculated the per-day selection rate of tetraploid versus diploid strain, using the formula \\( r = \\log(0.8) \\) of tetraploids on day 3/% of tetraploids on day 0) – log(0.6) of diploids on day 3/% of diploids on day 0)/3 days.\n\n## Evolution experiment with selection against larger size\n\nWe revived PM/Pat 0 and PM/PAl–5 t1,000 isolates from glycerol stocks by growing them on YPD plates at 30 °C for 2 days. Then, we inoculated each of the 12 strains into 10 ml of YPD media and grew them at 30 °C with 250 rpm shaking overnight, from which we transferred 20 µl to inoculate each of the four replicate populations for the evolution experiment. We grew the 48 populations in a 30 °C static incubator for 70 days (approximately 500 generations) in a spatially structured environment using 24-well plates containing 2 ml of YPD agar per well. Every 24 h, we resuspended each population in 1 ml of saline solution (0.85% NaCl), pre-diluted it in a microcentrifuge tube, and then transferred 20 µl of the diluted resuspension onto fresh YPD agar and spread it out by gently rocking the 24-well plate. We initially used a pre-dilution factor of 1:2 (for a total dilution of 1:100 after accounting for the volume placed), but we increased it to 1:4 (total 1:200) on day 36 after the populations had adapted to this selection regime. We prepared glycerol stocks of each population every 7 days by mixing 800 µl of the undiluted saline resuspension with 400 µl of 70% glycerol and stored them at −80 °C. Before routine protocols of measuring ploidy level and cluster size, we revived the populations by scraping a big chunk from the glycerol stocks and growing them in 10 ml of YPD to saturation for 2 days (without transferring after the first 24 h).\n\n## Mutation accumulation experiment\n\nWe first streaked the strains from glycerol stocks onto YPD plates. Every 2 days of growth on YPD plates at 30 °C, we picked the colony farthest from the initial streak point and streaked it onto a new YPD plate. This method ensures that we were unbiased in colony selection and that we were sampling colonies founded by small snowflake yeast branches that each descended from a single cell\\(^{28}\\), providing a unicellular genetic bottleneck at each transfer. We ran the mutation accumulation experiment for 28 transfers (56 days) and prepared glycerol stocks for the evolved populations every seven transfers. In this experiment, replicate population B of PA to displayed greatly reduced cell size that made it difficult to resolve the nuclei during ploidy measurements, and this population was thus removed from our results.\n\n## Isolating donut and spread colonies\n\nTo isolate one pair of donut and spread colonies from a macroscopic strain, we first streaked the strain from glycerol stocks onto a YPD plate and grew it at 30 °C for 2 days. As streaking or plating a multicellular strain does not ensure that a colony is founded by a single cell, we used chitinase (C8241, Sigma) to break clusters down to single cells (although some tiny branches exist after digestion, they should have gone through a recent single-cell bottleneck) before plating cells and isolating donut or spread colonies below.\n\nTo isolate a donut colony, we picked a single donut colony on the YPD plate and transferred it into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 800 µl of chitinase solution (0.25 mg ml\\(^{-1}\\) chitinase is 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0). We broke apart the colony by pipetting with 100-µl regular-bore tips and vortexing, and then incubated it at 30 °C for 8 h with gentle rotation on a mini-rotator (Bio RS-24, BioSan) at level 5. After chitinase digestion, we washed the cells twice with 1 ml of H\\(_2\\)O and spread them on YPD plates with three dilution factors (1:400, 1:1,000 and 1:2, 500). We incubated the plates at 30 °C for 3 days. Then, we picked a single donut colony from the plates and grew it in 10 ml of YPD media at 30 °C with 250 rpm shaking for 24 h, from which we prepared glycerol stocks by mixing 500 µl of the culture and 500 µl of 70% glycerol. This served as our donut isolate.\n\nTo isolate a spread colony, we transferred 100 µl of the above 24-h culture into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, washed it twice with 1 ml of H\\(_2\\)O and resuspended it in 800 µl of chitinase solution. We performed chitinase digestion, washing, plating and plate incubation in the same way as above for the donut isolate, except for plating at\n\n===== Page 13 =====\n\ndilution factors of 1:800, 1:2,000 and 1:5,000 with three plates each. From these nine plates that contained approximately 1,000 colonies, we could usually find more than one spread colony. However, as chitinase does not perfectly digest clusters into single cells, it is challenging to accurately estimate the frequency of donut-to-spread transitions. We picked one single spread colony and streaked it on a YPD plate to confirm the spread colony morphology and to apply an additional round of clonal isolation. We incubated the plate at 30 °C for 2 days. Then, we picked a single spread colony, and we grew it in YPD media and prepared glycerol stocks in the same way as above for the donut isolate. This served as our spread isolate for the corresponding donut isolate. As each spread colony was isolated from plating the 24-h liquid culture inoculated from a donut colony, we limited the number of cell generations between donut and spread phenotypes, which allowed us to better pinpoint the relevant genetic changes and also showed how rapidly macroscopic sizes can be lost.\n\nIn total, we prepared 25 donut-spread pairs from the nine macroscopic PA isolates, including two pairs from the PA11600 isolate (because the donut strain in the third pair did not grow macroscopic in later experiments) and the PA511,000 isolate (because we were only able to obtain two pairs after many attempts) as well as three pairs from each of the other seven isolates.\n\n**Statistics**\n\nWe performed statistical tests using R (v4.1.2), with the details described in the main text and figure legends. We implemented support vector machine in Fig. 4e using scikit-learn (v1.3.2) in Python (v3.11.6). We ran the biophysical simulations in MATLAB (R2019a).\n\n**Reporting summary**\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n---\n\n### Data availability\n\nUnderlying data used to make the figures as well as raw experimental data are available on GitHub (https://github.com/ktong25/WGD_in_MuITEE).

Procedure for engineering isogenic grande diploid and tetraploid clusters, from each of which four independent petite mutants were isolated. Isolating multiple petite mutants is important because petite mutations are not isogenic and may confound ploidy-phenotype map.

To study the effects of oxygen availability, we evolved these yeast under mixotrophic (PM1-5) or anaerobic (PA1-5) condition, making a total of 2 x 5 = 10 replicate populations. Tetraploidy rapidly emerged and was maintained in all ten populations. PM1-5 remained microscopic and are mostly euploid, while PA1-5 evolved macroscopic size with extensive aneuploidy. This study examines how polyploidy arises, becomes maintained and drives long-term adaptation through phenotypic characterization, genome sequencing, synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modeling and evolution experiments.\n\nResearch sample\n\nWe used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as our model organism. This organism is a well-established eukaryotic model system, making it genetically tractable and phenotypically accessible. To initiate our experiment with a multicellular phenotype, we deleted ACE2 gene from the yeast.\n\nSampling strategy\n\nWe began our evolution experiment with five replicate populations and two metabolic treatment groups. For phenotypic characterization and genome sequencing, we isolated a single clonal snowflake yeast cluster from these populations at day 200, 400, 600, and 1000 and sequenced those isolates. To measure multicellular size, we collected data from an average of 886 multicellular clusters per isolate. To measure cell volume and aspect ratio, we collected data from an average of 1288 cells per isolate. To measure ploidy, we collected data from an average of 12922 cells per isolate.\n\nData collection\n\nGOB performed the long-term evolution experiment and stored a -80C archive of each population every 10-15 days. The data were collected by KT, SD, SG, HIV, TCD, DL, and PLC without any manipulation by the experimenter. Cluster size, cell volume and aspect ratio, and ploidy data were collected using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope at the Ratcliff Lab. Genome sequencing data was generated at the Microbial Sequencing Center in University of Pittsburgh.\n\n===== Page 27 =====\n\nTiming and spatial scale\n\nLong-term evolution experiment (the first 1000 days) was performed between 2017-2021 (paused during COVID-19). Multicellular size, cell volume and aspect ratio, ploidy and genome data collection and analysis were performed in 2022-2024.\n\nData exclusions\n\nNo data were excluded from the analysis.\n\nReproducibility\n\nAll ten populations (PM1-5, PA1-5) evolved and maintained polyploidy. All PM1-5 remained microscopic and mostly eupioid, while all PA1-5 evolved macroscopic clusters with extensive aneuploidy. This parallel trend not only demonstrates the reproducibility of our data but also provides confidence that, if these populations were to be re-evolved, the same outcome (polyploidy and aneuploidy) would arise. We have kept a frozen record of all those strain isolates and populations in our -80C freezer, which are available for further analysis, such as replicating our results.\n\nRandomization\n\nTo ensure masked sample collection, we assigned random labels to samples at all stages of data collection.\n\nBlinding\n\nBlinding was not necessary for our study as we did not need to make any decisions based on phenotypic analysis. We collected multicellular size, cell volume and aspect ratio, and ploidy data by sampling a significant portion of the clusters from the cultures.\n\nDid the study involve field work?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nReporting for specific materials, systems and methods\n\nWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies.

            "content": "First, I need to analyze the optimal fluorescent timer (FT) design for tracking cellular age and lineage in yeast. The yeast cell cycle is about 87 minutes, which is roughly 1.45 hours. I have three FT variants with different maturation rates from Subach et al. 2009. I need to consider their in vitro and cellular maturation times, but since yeast is at 30°C, I should adjust for temperature. The data provided is at 37°C and 25°C, so I'll need to estimate for 30°C.\n\nFrom the FT properties, maturation is temperature-dependent with Q10 ≈ 2.0. Q10 is the factor by which the rate changes for a 10°C change. So, from 37°C to 30°C, that's a decrease of 7°C, so the rate should decrease by a factor of 2^(7/10) ≈ 2^0.7 ≈ 1.624. So, maturation times will be longer at 30°C compared to 37°C.\n\nLet me list the key maturation times for each FT at 37°C from in vitro data:\n\n- Fast-FT: Blue peak at 0.25h, Red half-max at 7.1h\n\n- Medium-FT: Blue peak at 1.2h, Red half-max at 3.9h\n\n- Slow-FT: Blue peak at 9.8h, Red half-max at 28h\n\nIn cellular environments, maturation is slower due to translation delays and degradation. For example, in S2 cells at 25°C:\n\n- Fast-FT: Blue peak at 13h, Red development over 200h\n\n- Medium-FT: Blue peak at 21h, Red half-max at 197h\n\n- Slow-FT: Blue peak at 80h, Red development beyond 200h\n\nYeast is at 30°C, which is between 25°C and 37°C. I need to estimate maturation times at 30°C for yeast.\n\nFirst, for in vitro-like conditions, but since we're in cells, I should look at cellular data. The cellular data is from S2 cells at 25°C, and yeast is at 30°C, so rates should be faster at 30°C than at 25°C.\n\nQ10=2, so from 25°C to 30°C, increase of 5°C, so rate increases by 2^(5/10)=2^0.5≈1.414. So, times should be shorter by factor 1/1.414≈0.707.\n\nBut the cellular times are much longer than in vitro due to translation and degradation. For yeast, I need to consider the specific environment.\n\nFrom the FT literature, all FTs show similar timing behavior across cell types, so I can assume that in yeast, the relative maturation times will be similar, but scaled based on temperature.\n\nThe yeast cell cycle is 87 minutes ≈ 1.45 hours. I want to track cell age from birth to division, so over about 1.45 hours. Also, across multiple generations, so I need an FT that changes significantly over this timescale.\n\nThe ratio r(t) = R/(B+R) should change measurably during the cell cycle.\n\nNow, looking at the FT maturation times:\n\n- Fast-FT in cells at 25°C: Blue peak at 13h, which is way longer than the cell cycle. Even at 30°C, if I scale down, 13h * 0.707 ≈ 9.2h, still much longer than 1.45h.\n\nSimilarly, for Medium-FT: Blue peak at 21h at 25°C, at 30°C ~21*0.707≈14.8h.\n\nSlow-FT: Blue peak at 80h at 25°C, at 30°C ~80*0.707≈56.6h.\n\nAll these are much longer than the yeast cell cycle. This means that if I express FTs constitutively, the maturation over a single cell cycle will be very small, so Δr will be small, and it might be hard to detect changes.\n\nBut I need to track cell age from birth to division, so over 1.45 hours. The FTs have maturation times in hours, so for Fast-FT, at 30°C in cells, let's estimate the blue peak time.\n\nFrom in vitro at 37°C, Fast-FT blue peak at 0.25h. In cells, it's slower. From S2 data at 25°C, Fast-FT blue peak at 13h vs in vitro at 37°C 0.25h. But temperature difference: 37°C to 25°C is 12°C decrease, so rate decrease by 2^(12/10)=2^1.2≈2.3, so in vitro at 25°C would be 0.25h * 2.3 ≈ 0.575h? No, maturation time increases as rate decreases. Rate at 25°C = rate at 37°C / 2.3, so time at 25°C = time at 37°C * 2.3. So in vitro at 25°C, Fast-FT blue peak at 0.25 * 2.3 ≈ 0.575h. But in S2 cells, it's 13h, so there's a huge delay due to cellular factors—translation and degradation.\n\nSimilarly, for yeast, I need to account for cellular environment. The paper says that in cells, maturation times are longer due to translation delays and degradation. From the kinetic model in cells, they have steps for mRNA to protein and degradation.\n\nFor yeast, the translation and degradation rates might be different, but I have to use the available data.\n\nPerhaps for yeast, I can assume similar scaling as in S2 or HeLa cells.\n\nBut the cell cycle is short, so I need an FT that matures quickly. Fast-FT has the shortest maturation, but even then, in cells, it takes hours.\n\nLet's look at the red half-max times, which indicate when red fluorescence is half-maximal, so the ratio r(t) might be changing around that time.\n\nFor Fast-FT in cells at 25°C, red half-max is not given, but from Fig. 3, for Fast-FT in S2 cells, red fluorescence increases over time and reaches max at 200h, so half-max might be around 100h or so? That's too long.\n\nFrom the in vitro data, red half-max is at 7.1h for Fast-FT at 37°C, so in cells at 25°C, it would be even longer.\n\nThis seems problematic for tracking yeast cell cycle over 1.45 hours.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. The FTs are designed for longer-term trafficking, like over days, but for yeast cell cycle, I need a much faster timer.\n\nPerhaps I can use the blue phase alone? But the timer is based on the ratio from blue to red.\n\nAnother thought: if I use a periodic promoter, I can express the FT only at specific times, and then track the maturation of that pulse over time.\n\nFor example, if I express FT briefly at cell birth, then as the cell ages, the FT protein matures from blue to red, so by measuring the ratio, I can infer the time since expression.\n\nThat might work better for short timescales.\n\nSo, for tracking cell age from birth to division, I can use a promoter that expresses at cell birth, and then measure r(t) over the cell cycle.\n\nThe maturation time of the FT should be on the order of the cell cycle for good resolution.\n\nSo, I need an FT where the ratio changes significantly over 1.45 hours.\n\nLet's estimate the ratio change for each FT over 1.45 hours.\n\nFirst, I need the maturation kinetics. From the kinetic model, the ratio r(t) = R/(B+R) changes with time.\n\nFrom Fig. 2d-f, for each FT, the red-to-blue ratio changes with time. But those are for purified proteins or in cells over long times.\n\nFor Fast-FT at 37°C in vitro, from Fig. 2d, the ratio starts from 0 and increases, but at early times, it's very low. Over 1.45 hours, what is the ratio?\n\nFrom in vitro Fast-FT at 37°C, blue peaks at 0.25h, so at 0.25h, B is max, R is low, so r is low. After 0.25h, B decreases and R increases. At 1.45h, from Fig. 2c, for Fast-FT at 37°C, at 1.45h, B is decreasing, R is increasing, but let's see the values.\n\nFrom Fig. 2c, at 37°C, for Fast-FT, at time 1h, B is about half of peak? Peak at 0.25h, so at 1h, B is less than half, and R is still low. The ratio from Fig. 2d, at 1h, for Fast-FT at 37°C, the ratio is still very low, maybe around 0.1 or less? Hard to see from the figure, but from the model, I can estimate.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, the ratio r(t) depends on the rates.\n\nBut for cellular environments, it's slower.\n\nPerhaps for yeast, I need to choose the Fast-FT because it's the fastest, and hope that at 30°C, with cellular factors, it might be fast enough.\n\nBut from S2 cells at 25°C, Fast-FT blue peak at 13h, so over 1.45h, very little change.\n\nAt 30°C, it might be faster, but let's calculate.\n\nFrom S2 at 25°C, Fast-FT blue peak at 13h. At 30°C, time should be shorter by factor from 25°C to 30°C, rate increase by 2^(5/10)=1.414, so time decrease by 1/1.414=0.707, so blue peak at 13*0.707=9.2h. Still much longer than 1.45h.\n\nSimilarly for other FTs.\n\nSo, if I use constitutive expression, the FT maturation is too slow for the yeast cell cycle.\n\nTherefore, for tracking cell age over a single cell cycle, I need to use a periodic promoter that expresses the FT at a specific time, and then track the maturation of that protein cohort.\n\nSo, for example, if I express FT only at the start of the cell cycle, then the FT proteins synthesized at that time will mature over time, and since no new synthesis, the ratio r(t) for that cohort will change with time.\n\nThe rate of change of r(t) will depend on the maturation kinetics of the FT.\n\nSo, for short timescales, I need an FT that matures quickly, so that r(t) changes significantly over 1.45 hours.\n\nSo, Fast-FT is the best choice because it has the fastest maturation.\n\nNow, for Fast-FT, what is the maturation rate in cells at 30°C?\n\nI need to estimate the time constant for maturation.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, the maturation from B to R involves steps, but for simplicity, the ratio r(t) increases with time.\n\nFrom in vitro at 37°C, for Fast-FT, the ratio starts from 0 and increases, and from Fig. 2d, at 1h, the ratio is still low, but let's see the value. From Fig. 2d, for Fast-FT at 37°C, the ratio at 1h is approximately 0.2? I can't see exactly, but from the curve, it seems around 0.1 to 0.2.\n\nBut at 37°C in vitro, over 1h, ratio changes from 0 to 0.2, so Δr=0.2 over 1h.\n\nAt 30°C, rate slower, so Δr over 1h would be less.\n\nBut in cells, it's slower, so for Fast-FT in cells at 30°C, over 1.45h, Δr might be small.\n\nPerhaps I can look at the initial slope of r(t).\n\nFrom the kinetic model, for Fast-FT, the rate constants at 37°C are given in Supplementary Table 2 online, but I don't have the values here. From the main text, for Fast-FT at 37°C, kB=8.7 h^{-1}, kI=0.78 h^{-1}, kR=0.14 h^{-1} from Scheme 1 and Supplementary Table 2? Let's see the text.\n\nOn page 4, for Fast-FT at 37°C, kB=8.7 h^{-1}, kI=0.78 h^{-1}, kR=0.14 h^{-1} from Supplementary Table 2.\n\nBut these are for purified proteins. In cells, there are additional steps.\n\nFrom model (2) for cells, they have kC for mRNA to protein, and kD for degradation.\n\nFor HeLa cells at 37°C, for Medium-FT, kC=0.29 h^{-1}, kD=0.028 h^{-1}, and kB,kI,kR are the same as in vitro? From the text, for fitting, kB,kI,kR are kept the same as for purified proteins.\n\nSo, in cells, the maturation kinetics per protein are the same, but the overall fluorescence is affected by translation and degradation.\n\nFor the ratio r(t) = R/(B+R), if I have a pulse of expression, then after expression stops, the B and R proteins mature, and degradation affects both, but since degradation is slow, it might be negligible over short times.\n\nFrom HeLa cells, kD=0.028 h^{-1}, so half-life of proteins is ln(2)/0.028 ≈ 24.75 hours, so over 1.45 hours, degradation is minimal.\n\nSimilarly, for yeast, protein half-lives might be similar or shorter, but let's assume for now that degradation is slow over cell cycle.\n\nSo, for a pulse of expression, the maturation of the protein cohort can be described by the in vitro kinetics, but at cellular temperature.\n\nSo, for Fast-FT at 30°C, I need the maturation rate constants at 30°C.\n\nFrom in vitro at 37°C, kB=8.7 h^{-1}, etc.\n\nAt 30°C, rate constants will be smaller. Q10=2, so from 37°C to 30°C, rate decrease by 2^(7/10)=2^0.7≈1.624, so kB at 30°C = 8.7 / 1.624 ≈ 5.36 h^{-1}\n\nSimilarly, kI=0.78 / 1.624 ≈ 0.48 h^{-1}\n\nkR=0.14 / 1.624 ≈ 0.086 h^{-1}\n\nNow, for a pulse of expression at t=0, the time evolution of B and R.\n\nFrom model (1): C -> B -> I -> R\n\nBut C is the immature form, which is produced from translation. For a pulse, after expression, C is formed, then it converts to B, etc.\n\nThe ratio r(t) = R/(B+R)\n\nI need to find how r(t) changes with time.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, the time to reach certain ratio.\n\nFor Fast-FT, the red half-max is at 7.1h at 37°C in vitro, so at 30°C, it would be 7.1 * 1.624 ≈ 11.5 hours, which is still long.\n\nBut for short times, the ratio might change slowly.\n\nLet's calculate the initial rate of change of r(t).\n\nFrom the differential equations.\n\nBut perhaps I can use the fact that for early times, B is increasing first, then decreasing, but for ratio, when B is high, r is low, when R is high, r is high.\n\nFor Fast-FT, blue peaks at 0.25h at 37°C, so at 30°C, blue peaks at 0.25 * 1.624 ≈ 0.406 hours ≈ 24.36 minutes.\n\nSo, after expression, B increases and peaks at about 24 minutes, then decreases. R starts increasing later.\n\nOver the cell cycle of 87 minutes, from birth to division, if I express at birth, then at division, time since expression is 87 minutes ≈ 1.45 hours.\n\nAt 1.45 hours at 30°C, for Fast-FT, from blue peak at 0.406h, at 1.45h, B has decreased, and R has increased.\n\nFrom in vitro at 37°C, at 1.45h, for Fast-FT, from Fig. 2c, B is about half of peak? Let's assume that at 1.45h at 37°C, B is less than peak, and R is still low.\n\nBut at 30°C, times are longer, so at 1.45h at 30°C, it might be even earlier in the maturation process.\n\nSo, for Fast-FT at 30°C, blue peaks at 0.406h, so at 1.45h, it is after the blue peak, so B is decreasing, R is increasing.\n\nThe ratio r(t) = R/(B+R). At blue peak, B is max, R is small, so r is small. As time goes on, B decreases and R increases, so r increases.\n\nThe rate of increase of r depends on the maturation rates.\n\nFor Fast-FT, the limiting step for red formation is I->R since kR is small compared to kB for Fast-FT? From text, for Fast-FT, kB >> kR, so I->R is limiting.\n\nSo, the increase in R is slow, so r increases slowly.\n\nOver 1.45 hours, from expression at t=0, at t=1.45h, what is r?\n\nI need to solve the kinetics.\n\nFrom the in vitro data at 37°C, for Fast-FT, the ratio at 1h is let's say from Fig. 2d, it looks like around 0.1 for Fast-FT at 37°C? From Fig. 2d, the ratio for Fast-FT at 37°C at 1h is approximately 0.1? But the axis is red-to-blue ratio, which is R/B, not R/(B+R).\n\nIn Fig. 2d-f, it's red-to-blue ratio, which is R/B, not the ratio r used in the text for age determination.\n\nIn the text, for age determination, they use the red-to-blue ratio, which is R/B, but for the timer function, r(t) = R/(B+R) is also used? Let's see.\n\nIn the paper, for cellular trafficking, they use the red and blue fluorescence, and for age, they use the ratio between red and blue.\n\nFrom page 7, \"by comparing the red-to-blue ratios\" and \"red-to-blue ratio\", so it's R/B ratio.\n\nIn Fig. 2i, it's the ratio between red and blue forms, so likely R/B.\n\nIn model, they might use R/B or R/(B+R).\n\nBut for age reporting, the ratio R/B is used, as it increases with time.\n\nFrom Fig. 2d-f, R/B ratio increases with time.\n\nSo, for Fast-FT at 37°C in vitro, R/B ratio at 1h is from Fig. 2d, it seems around 0.5? Let's estimate from the figure.\n\nIn Fig. 2d, for Fast-FT at 37°C, the ratio at 1h is approximately 0.3? I think it's hard to see, but from the curve, it might be around 0.2 to 0.3.\n\nBut for accuracy, from the kinetic model, I can calculate.\n\nFrom Supplementary Table 2, for Fast-FT at 37°C, kB=8.7 h^{-1}, kI=0.78 h^{-1}, kR=0.14 h^{-1}\n\nNow, the ratio R/B.\n\nFrom the model, the time evolution of B and R.\n\nThe system is: C -> B -> I -> R\n\nWith rate constants kB, kI, kR.\n\nIf I assume that initially at t=0, all protein is in C form, then B(t) and R(t) can be calculated.\n\nBut for a pulse, after expression, C is produced, but if expression is brief, I can assume that at t=0, C=C0, and then it matures.\n\nSo, from the differential equations:\n\ndC/dt = -kB C\n\ndB/dt = kB C - kI B\n\ndI/dt = kI B - kR I\n\ndR/dt = kR I\n\nWith initial conditions: at t=0, C=C0, B=0, I=0, R=0\n\nThen C(t) = C0 exp(-kB t)\n\nB(t) = kB C0 [ exp(-kB t) - exp(-kI t) ] / (kI - kB) if kB != kI\n\nBut since kB and kI are different, this is messy.\n\nFrom the data, for Fast-FT, kB=8.7 h^{-1}, kI=0.78 h^{-1}, kR=0.14 h^{-1}\n\nkB is large, so C quickly converts to B, so approximately, after short time, C is zero, and B is at max, then B converts to I, and I to R.\n\nSo, after t=0, B increases rapidly to peak at t= ln(kB/kI)/(kB-kI) but since kB>>kI, peak B at t≈ ln(kB/kI)/kB\n\nFrom kB=8.7, kI=0.78, ln(8.7/0.78)=ln(11.15)=2.41, so t=2.41/8.7=0.277h, which matches blue peak at 0.25h.\n\nThen after that, B decays with rate approximately kI=0.78 h^{-1}, so half-life of B is ln2/0.78=0.89h.\n\nSimilarly, I increases and then converts to R.\n\nR increases with rate limited by kR=0.14 h^{-1}, so initially R increases slowly.\n\nThe ratio R/B: at early times, B is large, R is small, so R/B is small.\n\nAs time goes on, B decreases, R increases, so R/B increases.\n\nThe rate of increase of R/B depends on how fast B decreases and R increases.\n\nB decreases with rate ~kI=0.78 h^{-1}, so after 1h, B is about exp(-0.78*1)=0.46 of peak, so roughly half.\n\nR increases with rate ~kR=0.14 h^{-1}, so after 1h, R is about kR * t * I_avg, but I_avg is around, from model, I peaks later.\n\nApproximately, from the red half-max time, for Fast-FT, red half-max at 7.1h, so at 1h, R is very small.\n\nSo R/B at 1h is very small.\n\nFrom Fig. 2d, for Fast-FT at 37°C, R/B at 1h is indeed small, looks like 0.1 or less.\n\nSo over 1h, R/B changes from 0 to 0.1, so Δ(R/B) = 0.1 over 1h.\n\nAt 30°C, rates are slower, so over 1.45h, Δ(R/B) might be even smaller.\n\nFor example, at 30°C, kI=0.48 h^{-1}, kR=0.086 h^{-1}, so B decays slower, R increases slower, so R/B increases slower.\n\nOver 1.45h, R/B might change by less than 0.1.\n\nWith experimental noise σ=0.03, a change of 0.1 might be detectable, but barely, and since it's less at 30°C, it might not be good.\n\nFor Medium-FT, at 37°C in vitro, blue peak at 1.2h, red half-max at 3.9h, so over 1.45h, it is around blue peak time, so R/B is very low, and change is small.\n\nSimilarly for Slow-FT, worse.\n\nSo, for all FTs, if used with constitutive expression, the maturation is too slow for the yeast cell cycle.\n\nTherefore, for tracking cell age over a single cell cycle, I need to use a periodic promoter with pulse expression, and I need an FT that matures quickly enough that the ratio changes significantly over the cell cycle.\n\nBut from above, even with pulse expression, the maturation times are hours, so for Fast-FT, after pulse, the ratio changes significantly only after hours, not over 1.45 hours.\n\nSo, perhaps for yeast cell cycle, the available FTs are not suitable because they are too slow.\n\nBut that can't be right; I need to find a way.\n\nPerhaps for yeast, I can use a different FT or engineer a faster FT.\n\nBut based on the given FTs, I have to choose the fastest one, Fast-FT.\n\nMaybe for lineage tracking across multiple generations, I don't need to resolve within cell cycle, but between generations.\n\nFor example, if I want to track how many generations old a cell is, then over multiple cell cycles, the FT ratio can change.\n\nFor instance, if a cell is from an old lineage, the FT proteins have been maturing for longer, so r(t) is higher.\n\nSo, for lineage tracking, I might use the FT to indicate the age of the lineage or the time since a event.\n\nBut for cell age from birth, it might not work within cell cycle.\n\nSo, for this application, tracking cell age from birth to division, it might not be feasible with these FTs due to slow maturation.\n\nBut let's confirm the timescale.\n\nYeast cell cycle: 87 minutes = 1.45 hours.\n\nFast-FT in cells at 30°C: from S2 at 25°C, blue peak at 13h, so at 30°C, 9.2h, so over 1.45h, the blue fluorescence is still increasing, so B is increasing, R is very low, so R/B is very low and not changing much.\n\nSo, indeed, the ratio change is negligible.\n\nTherefore, for tracking within cell cycle, these FTs are not suitable.\n\nBut perhaps for longer-term tracking, like over multiple cycles, it could work.\n\nThe user said \"track cell age from birth to division and across multiple generations\" so for across multiple generations, it might work.\n\nFor example, if I express FT constitutively, then in old cells, the FT has been maturing longer, so R/B is higher, while in newborn cells, R/B is lower.\n\nBut since proteins are diluted at division, in newborn cells, they inherit proteins from mother, so the R/B ratio might indicate the maternal age or something.\n\nIn yeast, at division, mother and daughter cells share the cytoplasm, so both inherit the existing proteins. So, for a daughter cell, at birth, it has a certain amount of B and R proteins from the mother, and then as it grows, new proteins are synthesized, so the ratio changes.\n\nBut with constitutive expression, the ratio might reflect the cumulative age of the cell lineage.\n\nBut for specific age from birth, it might be messy.\n\nWith periodic expression, if I express only at birth, then the protein cohort age matches the cell age.\n\nBut with slow maturation, the ratio change is small.\n\nSo, for this application, I think Fast-FT is the best among the three, but it may not provide good temporal resolution within the cell cycle.\n\nPerhaps I can use the blue fluorescence alone? But the timer is based on the ratio, and blue alone might be affected by expression level etc.\n\nSo, for the purpose of this analysis, I'll assume that Fast-FT is the most suitable because it has the fastest maturation, and for yeast, at 30°C, with cellular factors, it might have some change over multiple hours, but for single cell cycle, it might not be ideal.\n\nBut let's proceed with the analysis.\n\nSo, for FT type selection, I choose Fast-FT.\n\nNow, for promoter strategy, since constitutive expression would have continuous synthesis, which dilutes the age signal, because new proteins are always being added, which are blue, so the ratio might not reflect age well.\n\nFor example, if expression is constitutive, then at any time, there are proteins of all ages, so the ratio r(t) is an average over the age distribution, and it might reach a steady state where r(t) is constant, so it doesn't change with cell age.\n\nFrom the kinetic model, with constitutive expression, the B and R pools reach steady state after some time, so r(t) becomes constant, so it doesn't indicate age.\n\nTherefore, for age tracking, periodic expression is better, where we express only at specific times, so that the protein cohort has a uniform age, and then r(t) for that cohort indicates the time since expression.\n\nSo, for promoter strategy, I recommend periodic promoter.\n\nNow, for pulse optimization, if using periodic promoter, what pulse characteristics?\n\nThe pulse should be brief so that all proteins are synthesized at approximately the same time.\n\nThe timing should be at the start of the age measurement, so for cell age from birth, express at cell birth.\n\nThe duration should be short compared to the cell cycle, so that the protein age is well-defined.\n\nExpression level should be sufficient for good signal, but not too high to cause crowding or resource issues.\n\nFor yeast, there are promoters that are expressed at specific cell cycle phases. For example, ASH1 is expressed in daughter cells after division, so around birth.\n\nSo, pulse at cell birth.\n\nDuration: as short as possible, but limited by promoter kinetics. Ideally, less than the cell cycle, say minutes instead of hours.\n\nBut since the cell cycle is 87 minutes, a pulse of few minutes might be good.\n\nNow, for expression level, I need to ensure that the fluorescence is detectable above noise, but since yeast is small, I might need sufficient expression.\n\nBut from the FT properties, the quantum yields are around 0.3 for blue and 0.09 for red, so blue is brighter, but with microscopy, it should be detectable.\n\nNow, for the pulse, after expression, the FT proteins mature, and I measure R/B ratio.\n\nThe change in R/B over time should be as large as possible for good resolution.\n\nFor Fast-FT, the R/B ratio increases with time, but slowly.\n\nTo maximize Δ(R/B) over the cell cycle, I need an FT with steeper increase in R/B over 1.45 hours.\n\nBut since all FTs are slow, Fast-FT has the steepest initial increase? From Fig. 2d, for Fast-FT, the R/B ratio curve is steeper at early times compared to others? From Fig. 2d, at early times, Fast-FT has higher slope than Medium-FT or Slow-FT? Let's see Fig. 2d: for Fast-FT at 37°C, the ratio increases quickly initially, but from the figure, it seems that Medium-FT has a steeper increase at early times? No, from Fig. 2d, for Fast-FT, the ratio starts from 0 and increases, and the slope is higher than for Medium-FT at early times? Actually, from Fig. 2d, at time 0, all have ratio 0, and Fast-FT increases faster initially.\n\nFor example, at 1h, Fast-FT has ratio around 0.3, Medium-FT has ratio around 0.1, Slow-FT has ratio around 0.05, so Fast-FT has higher ratio at early times, so for short times, Fast-FT is better.\n\nSo, for tracking over 1.45 hours, Fast-FT will have the highest R/B ratio change.\n\nSo, Fast-FT is best.\n\nNow for expression level, I need to choose promoter strength.\n\nIf promoter is too weak, signal might be low, and noise might be high.\n\nIf promoter is too strong, it might cause burden on the cell, or saturation of detection, but since fluorescence is linear with protein concentration, it should be fine, but very high expression might affect cell physiology.\n\nAlso, with high expression, the absolute fluorescence is high, so noise relative to signal might be low, so better signal-to-noise.\n\nBut there might be practical limits.\n\nSo, I recommend medium to strong promoter for good signal.\n\nBut since yeast has high expression systems, I can use a strong promoter.\n\nNow, for the pulse, if I use a periodic promoter, the expression might be natural, so I don't control the pulse duration directly, but I can choose a promoter with short expression window.\n\nFor example, ASH1 promoter is expressed for a short time after cell division.\n\nSo, in summary, for FT type, I choose Fast-FT.\n\nFor promoter strategy, periodic promoter at cell birth.\n\nFor pulse characteristics, as brief as possible, timing at cell birth.\n\nFor expression level, medium to strong promoter.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide reasoning.\n\nSo, let's formalize."

            "content": "### Analysis of Fluorescent Timer Design for Yeast Cell Age and Lineage Tracking\n\nBased on the provided biological principles and experimental data from Subach et al. (2009) and the yeast system specifications, I analyze the optimal design parameters for a fluorescent timer (FT) to track cellular age from birth to division and across multiple generations in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The yeast cell cycle duration of ~87 minutes (1.45 hours) and the slow maturation kinetics of the FTs pose significant challenges for within-cell-cycle resolution. Below, I provide step-by-step reasoning for each design decision, focusing on fundamental biochemical, kinetic, and cellular constraints.\n\n#### 1. FT Type Selection\n- **Reasoning**:\n  - The yeast cell cycle is short (1.45 hours), while all FT variants have maturation timescales of hours to days in cellular environments (e.g., Fast-FT in S2 cells at 25°C has a blue fluorescence peak at ~13 hours). \n  - The ratio \\( r(t) = R/B \\) (red-to-blue fluorescence ratio) increases with time, but the rate of change \\( \\Delta r \\) over 1.45 hours is small for all FTs. \n  - Fast-FT has the fastest maturation kinetics:\n    - In vitro at 37°C: Blue peaks at 0.25 hours, red half-max at 7.1 hours.\n    - In cellular environments, maturation is slower due to translation delays and degradation (e.g., in S2 cells at 25°C, blue peaks at ~13 hours). \n    - At yeast growth temperature (30°C), maturation times are estimated using Q₁₀ ≈ 2.0: from 37°C to 30°C, rates decrease by ~1.624-fold, so Fast-FT blue peak at ~0.41 hours in vitro, but in cells, it is longer (~9.2 hours from S2 data scaled to 30°C). \n    - Over 1.45 hours, \\( \\Delta r \\) for Fast-FT is estimated to be small (<0.1) but larger than for Medium-FT or Slow-FT, as Fast-FT has the steepest initial slope in \\( r(t) \\) (Fig. 2d of Subach et al.).\n  - For tracking across multiple generations, Fast-FT can accumulate red fluorescence over time, allowing distinction between newborn cells (low \\( r \\)) and older lineages (high \\( r \\)). Within a single cell cycle, resolution is poor, but Fast-FT provides the best possible \\( \\Delta r \\) among the variants.\n- **Conclusion**: **Fast-FT** is the most suitable variant due to its fastest maturation kinetics, maximizing \\( \\Delta r \\) over short timescales and enabling lineage tracking over generations.\n- **Caveats**: \n  - The slow maturation may limit within-cell-cycle age resolution; \\( \\Delta r \\) over 1.45 hours might be near the detection limit (noise σ ≈ 0.03).\n  - Protein inheritance at division dilutes the signal, but \\( r(t) \\) can still indicate lineage age.\n\n#### 2. Promoter Strategy\n- **Reasoning**:\n  - **Constitutive expression** leads to continuous synthesis of immature (blue) FT proteins, causing the \\( r(t) \\) ratio to reach a steady state that does not reflect cell age. This dilutes the age signal because new proteins mask the maturation of older cohorts.\n  - **Periodic expression** (e.g., using a cell cycle-regulated promoter) allows synthesis of a synchronized protein cohort at a specific time (e.g., cell birth). After expression stops, \\( r(t) \\) for that cohort increases monotonically with time, directly correlating with cell age.\n  - From FT kinetics, after a pulse, the \\( r(t) \\) ratio evolves based on maturation rates without interference from new synthesis, enhancing age correlation.\n  - In yeast, promoters like ASH1 are naturally expressed briefly in daughter cells after division, aligning with cell birth.\n- **Conclusion**: **Periodic promoter** is optimal for age tracking, as it ensures that \\( r(t) \\) reflects the time since expression without contamination from newly synthesized proteins.\n- **Caveats**:\n  - Periodic promoters may have variable expression windows or noise, but brief pulses minimize age dispersion in the protein cohort.\n  - Endogenous promoter regulation must be carefully characterized to ensure precise timing.\n\n#### 3. Pulse Optimization (if periodic promoter is chosen)\n- **Reasoning**:\n  - **Pulse timing**: Should coincide with the start of age measurement—i.e., at cell birth—so that \\( r(t) \\) directly indicates time since birth.\n  - **Pulse duration**: Should be short compared to the cell cycle (87 minutes) to ensure a narrow age distribution of FT proteins. Ideal duration is minutes (e.g., <10% of cell cycle, ~8–15 minutes), limited by promoter kinetics and yeast gene expression timescales.\n  - **Expression level**: Sufficient amplitude is needed for detectable fluorescence, but the pulse should not be so long that it smears the age signal. A brief, high-amplitude pulse can provide a sharp cohort, but very high expression may cause cellular burden.\n  - The FT maturation kinetics (irreversible C → B → I → R) mean that after a pulse, \\( r(t) \\) increases with time. For Fast-FT, the initial increase in \\( r(t) \\) is relatively rapid, so a short pulse at birth maximizes the correlation between \\( r(t) \\) and cell age.\n- **Conclusion**: \n  - **Pulse timing**: At cell birth.\n  - **Pulse duration**: As short as possible (e.g., ≤15 minutes).\n  - **Expression level**: High amplitude to ensure good signal-to-noise, but not so high as to cause toxicity or saturation.\n- **Caveats**:\n  - Achieving very short pulses may require engineered promoters or inducible systems.\n  - Pulse timing must be synchronized with cell cycle events, which may vary between cells.\n\n#### 4. Expression Level Optimization\n- **Reasoning**:\n  - **Weak promoters** may yield insufficient fluorescence for accurate ratio measurement, especially since blue and red quantum yields are modest (0.30 and 0.09 for Fast-FT), and yeast cells are small.\n  - **Strong promoters** provide high signal intensity, reducing relative noise (σ ≈ 0.03), but may impose metabolic burden, affect cell cycle progression, or lead to protein aggregation/crowding.\n  - **Medium-strength promoters** offer a balance: adequate signal without significant burden. From FT properties, the molar extinction coefficients are reasonable (49,700 M⁻¹cm⁻¹ for blue Fast-FT), so medium expression should be detectable with standard microscopy.\n  - For periodic expression, the pulse amplitude should be high enough to generate a measurable cohort but not so high that it disrupts cellular processes. The signal should be above autofluorescence and noise.\n- **Conclusion**: **Medium to strong promoter** is recommended to ensure sufficient fluorescence for reliable \\( r(t) \\) measurement while minimizing cellular burden.\n- **Caveats**:\n  - Expression level should be validated empirically to avoid artifacts.\n  - Strong promoters might lead to heterogeneous expression in populations; using a well-characterized, consistent promoter is key.\n\n### Overall Recommendations and Limitations\n- **FT Type**: Fast-FT for fastest maturation.\n- **Promoter Strategy**: Periodic promoter (e.g., ASH1) expressed at cell birth.\n- **Pulse Characteristics**: Brief duration (≤15 minutes) with high expression amplitude.\n- **Expression Level**: Medium to strong promoter for optimal signal-to-noise.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - The slow maturation of FTs relative to the yeast cell cycle means that within-cell-cycle age resolution may be limited; \\( \\Delta r \\) over 1.45 hours is small, potentially requiring sensitive detection and averaging over multiple cells.\n  - Protein inheritance at division complicates lineage tracking, as daughter cells start with maternal FT proteins. However, with periodic expression at birth, the newborn cohort dominates, reducing this effect.\n  - Cellular environment (pH, temperature) affects FT kinetics; yeast cytosol pH (~6.0-6.5) is within the stable range for FTs (ratio changes <8% in pH 5.4–7.4), but temperature adjustments are needed for accurate kinetics.\n  - For better within-cell-cycle resolution, engineering a faster-maturing FT variant specific to yeast might be necessary, but based on given FTs, Fast-FT is the best choice.\n\nThis analysis relies solely on the provided biological principles and data, emphasizing the need for experimental validation in yeast to fine-tune parameters."
